# Denotational Semantics of the QVR DSL

This section gives a mathematical interpretation of the QVR DSL and records how that interpretation relates to the current implementation. Some results are conditional on algebraic laws that the runtime interface does not verify; the chapters mark those assumptions and distinguish them from tested behavior.

The development is organized as follows.

1. **[Setting and notation](setting.md).** The semantic universe: $\mathcal{V}$-enriched symmetric monoidal closed categories, finite sets, standard Borel spaces, and the global parameters that distinguish discrete, stochastic, and continuous fragments.
2. **[Algebras and base change](algebras.md).** The algebraic structure underlying $\mathcal{V}$-enriched composition, the eleven built-in algebras, and the base-change functors that mediate between them.
3. **[Composition rules](composition-rules.md).** The class hierarchy $\mathbf{CompositionRule} \supseteq \{\mathbf{BilinearForm},\ \mathbf{Semigroupoid} \supseteq \mathbf{Algebra}\}$; user-defined inline composition rules; operadic n-ary contractions via flat wirings; first-class transformations with sequential composition.
4. **[Types and spaces](types-and-spaces.md).** The denotation of `ObjectExpr` and `SpaceExpr` syntactic categories as objects in $\mathbf{FinSet}$ and $\mathbf{SBor}$ respectively.
5. **[Morphisms](morphisms.md).** $\mathcal{V}$-relations, stochastic kernels, and continuous conditional families as the three morphism strata; their composition, tensor product, marginalization, and trace.
6. **[Expressions](expressions.md).** Compositional semantics of expression-level combinators: `>>`, `>>>`, `@`, `.marginalize`, `.change_base`, `fan`, `repeat`, `stack`, `scan`, and the parser combinators.
7. **[Programs](programs.md).** Probability- and weighted-kernel semantics of `program` blocks; the denotation of bind (`<-`), `observe`, `let`, `score`, finite `marginalize`, and `return`; grouped marginalization with multi-observe fibrations; and the boundary between exact finite enumeration and ordinary sampling.
8. **[Typing and checking](typing.md).** The current two-layer checker: surface objects, spaces, axes, and family shapes; QIEC kinds, indexed families, computations, lexical effect rows, handlers, and program elaboration; plus the guarantees and dynamic limits of that implementation.
9. **[Weighted deduction fragment](grammar.md).** Item algebras, rule systems as hyperedges in a multicategory, semiring-weighted chart enumeration, axiom injectors, strategy independence, and differentiable charts. Includes learnable per-rule and bindings-keyed weights, hierarchical (`parent=`) and bounded (`bounded`) rule parameterizations, alpha-renamed binder blocks, convergent-cycle (`tolerance=`) chart evaluation, and the chart-access surface (`parse(D, x)`, `compose(D_1, D_2)`, `subst(t, v, w)`) that lifts a chart's goal weight into a `program`'s log-joint via a [`score`](programs.md#210-score-factor) step.
10. **[Schemas, rules, categories, bundles](schemas.md).** Category atoms; rule declarations as universally-quantified hyperedges; pattern-polymorphic schema declarations; bundles as first-class rule sets; the residuated type formers $/$, $\backslash$, $T(\cdot)$; free residuated category universes; object- and space-level aliases.
11. **[Structural compression](structural.md).** Signatures as generalized algebraic theories; encoders as initial-algebra catamorphisms into a vector carrier; decoders as Kleisli coalgebras of the Giry monad; losses as attached scalar functionals on training-site traces.
12. **[Compositional effects](effects.md).** Typeclass + algebraic-effects framework over a residuated category universe; class-driven schema lifting; joint type-and-effect dispatch in the chart parser; conservativity over the bare deduction fragment.
13. **[The program-shape protocol](program-theory.md).** Extraction of a compiled environment into a validating panproto `Schema`, plus the limits of schema equality.
14. **[Implementation correspondence and limits](adequacy.md).** Direct correspondences, test evidence, Monte Carlo qualifications, and open gaps.
15. **[Transpilation architecture](transpile-architecture.md).** The `Module -> IRProgram -> panproto.Schema -> bytes` pipeline, its shared family metadata, and backend renderers.
16. **[Transpilation correctness](transpile-correctness/index.md).** Structural, re-emission, external-syntax, and numeric-equivalence evidence, with per-target support notes: [Stan](transpile-correctness/stan.md), [NumPyro](transpile-correctness/numpyro.md), [Pyro](transpile-correctness/pyro.md), [PyMC](transpile-correctness/pymc.md), [Edward2](transpile-correctness/edward2.md), [Turing.jl](transpile-correctness/turing.md), [Gen.jl](transpile-correctness/gen.md), [Church](transpile-correctness/church.md), [WebPPL](transpile-correctness/webppl.md), [BUGS](transpile-correctness/bugs.md), and [JAGS](transpile-correctness/jags.md).

## Declaration surfaces

The categorical and probabilistic declarations use a shared option-block and
initializer vocabulary. Their common schematic shape is:

```
KIND NAME : SIGNATURE [k = v, ...] [~ INIT] [BODY]
```

This is not a production for every declaration. QIEC declarations have their
own checked forms: `index`, `family` and `constructor`, `effect` and
operations, `instance`, `handler`, and computation-valued `define`. Their
static telescopes, runtime telescopes, indexed results, and effect rows are
described in [Typing and checking](typing.md) and summarized in the
[grammar](grammar.md#11-qiec-fragment).

For the categorical/probabilistic shape above:

* `KIND` is one of `composition`, `category`, `object`, `morphism`, `bundle`, `program`, `contraction`, `export`, `deduction`, `signature`, `encoder`, `decoder`, `loss`, `schema`, or `rule`. A `define` may instead introduce a QIEC computation or one of the established expression aliases such as a parser or composed morphism. `let` is reserved for deterministic bindings inside computations and program bodies.
* `SIGNATURE` is a colon-prefixed phrase (an object value for `object`, a `dom -> cod` arrow for everything that denotes a morphism, an `inputs / codomain` shape for `contraction`, etc.).
* `[k = v, ...]` is the shared option block. Each declaration or step accepts a closed set of keys and rejects ignored or misspelled entries. Options select a role, shape, family, reduction, or elaboration policy; they are not an untyped metadata bag.
* `~ INIT` is the optional *initializer*: either a `Family(args)` clause (sampled stochastic kernel, evaluated through the family registry) or an arbitrary `expr` (deterministic morphism, evaluated through the expression denotation). On a `morphism` declaration the initializer interacts with `role` in the option block: `role=latent` admits only `~ Family(...)`; `role=let` / `role=observed` admits only `~ expr`; `role=kernel` admits both.
* `[BODY]` is an optional indented block: a rule list for `composition`, `deduction`, or `signature`; a step list for `program`; or the declaration-specific body defined by the grammar.

Pragmas are top-level *attribute* statements that decorate the *next* declaration (outer form `#[k = v, ...]`) or the *enclosing module* (inner form `#![k = v, ...]`). They carry the same `pragma_entry` shape as the unified option block; the compiler attaches the entries to the decorated declaration or module-level environment.

The deduction fragment adds a parallel form: lexicon entries and individual `rule` lines admit a trailing `#[k = v, ...]` pragma that controls per-entry / per-rule behavior (`learnable`, `bounded`, `parent`, `weight = expr`, etc.; see [Weighted deduction fragment §2.1–§2.3](grammar.md#21-learnable-rule-weights-learnable)).

## Conventions

Throughout, we use the following conventions.

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| $\mathcal{V}$ | A QVR algebra (see [Algebras §1](algebras.md)). |
| $\otimes,\ \mathbf{1}$ | Monoidal product and unit of $\mathcal{V}$. |
| $\bigoplus$ | The join of $\mathcal{V}$ (the costructure used to marginalize). |
| $\mathbf{FinSet}$ | The category of finite sets. |
| $\mathbf{SBor}$ | The category of standard Borel spaces with measurable maps. |
| $\mathcal{V}\text{-}\mathbf{Rel}$ | The $\mathcal{V}$-enriched category of $\mathcal{V}$-relations on finite sets. |
| $\mathbf{Stoch}$ | The Kleisli category of the (discrete) Giry monad. |
| $\mathbf{Kern}$ | The category of standard Borel spaces and Markov kernels. |
| $\mathcal{G}$ | The Giry monad (discrete or continuous, disambiguated by context). |
| $\llbracket \phi \rrbracket$ | The denotation of phrase $\phi$. |
| $\Gamma \vdash \phi : \tau$ | $\phi$ is well-typed of type $\tau$ under environment $\Gamma$. |
| $\rho$ | A semantic environment (assignment of denotations to free names). |

In the classic categorical surface, a *type* is a finite-set object and a
*space* is a standard Borel object. QIEC additionally has a `Type` kind for
primitive, product, distribution, and indexed-family types; [Typing and
checking](typing.md#4-qiec-kinds-and-types) keeps those two uses separate. We
write $|X|$ for the cardinality of a finite set $X$, and $\dim(S)$ for the
dimension of a continuous space $S$.

## Audience

This document is written for users who wish to reason formally about QVR programs: to verify that two `.qvr` files denote the same morphism, to prove that an optimization pass preserves meaning, or to understand the precise relationship between the syntactic AST, the `dx.Model` value-type layer, and the underlying tensor computations. Familiarity with enriched category theory at the level of Kelly's [*Basic Concepts of Enriched Category Theory*](http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/reprints/articles/10/tr10abs.html) and with the categorical foundations of probability ([Giry, 1982](https://doi.org/10.1007/BFb0092872); [Fritz, 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aim.2020.107239)) is assumed.
