# Term Autoencoder

## Overview

A stochastic autoencoder on simply typed lambda terms, built from the four structural declarations: a `signature` fixing the multi-sorted term algebra, an [`Encoder`](../api/structural/encoder.md#quivers.structural.encoder.Encoder) folding each term bottom-up into one fixed-width code vector, a [`Decoder`](../api/structural/decoder.md#quivers.structural.decoder.Decoder) corecursively expanding a code back into a term, and a loss head scoring the round trip by reconstruction negative log-likelihood.

This example wires all four declarations together in one module. It shows the keyword-led encoder body (an explicit `op` rule alongside compiler-scaffolded defaults), the per-encoder / per-decoder `dim` override, a binder that threads a [de Bruijn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bruijn_index) type annotation through the recursion, and a loss attached to a named site via `[on=...]`. The `#!` doc comments attach to the declaration that follows and are carried on its AST node's `docs` field.

## Walkthrough

### The signature

<!-- compile: false -->
```qvr
signature STLC
    sorts
        Term : object
        Type : object [dim=24]
        Name : data   [dim=24, vocab=["f", "x", "plus", "base"]]
    constructors
        Const : Name -> Term
        App   : Term, Term -> Term
        Base  : Name -> Type
    binders
        Lam : binds (x : Term : ty : Type) in (body : Term) -> Term
```

`Term` and `Type` are `object` sorts, decoded recursively; `Name` is a `data` sort whose closed `vocab` supplies the tokens the decoder samples and scores leaves from. `Term` deliberately omits its `dim`: each encoder or decoder over the signature must then supply one via a `dim Term = 24` body entry, and the compiler raises when neither the signature nor the block does. The `Lam` binder introduces a `Term`-sorted variable annotated by a `Type`; the framework threads that annotation through a typed de Bruijn context during both encoding and decoding.

### The encoder

<!-- compile: false -->
```qvr
encoder Enc : STLC
    dim Term = 24
    op App(fun, arg) |-> relu(fun + arg)
    var_init Term from Type as ty |-> ty
```

Every encoder body entry is keyword-led. The `op` keyword introduces a per-operation rewrite rule: `App`'s two child embeddings are summed and passed through `relu`. Operators without a rule (`Const`, `Base`, `Lam`) receive a compiler-scaffolded 2-layer MLP with the correct per-argument dimensions, so a body may override as few or as many operations as the model demands. The `var_init` entry sets the embedding a `Lam`-bound variable enters the context with; here the type annotation's embedding is passed through unchanged.

### The decoder

<!-- compile: false -->
```qvr
decoder Dec : STLC [depth=6]
    dim Term = 24
    body |-> recursive
```

The decoder header names its signature after `:`, exactly like the encoder header. `body |-> recursive` accepts the scaffolded corecursion: at every node the runtime scores constructor, binder, and bound-variable candidates for the current sort, splits the parent vector into per-child vectors, and recurses down to the `depth` bound. Each slot (structure, primitive, factor, binder selection) can instead be overridden with an explicit rule, as described in the [decoders and losses guide](../guides/structural-compression-decoders-and-losses.md).

### The loss

<!-- compile: false -->
```qvr
loss reconstruct [weight=1.0, on=decoder(Dec)]
    -Dec.log_prob(term, Enc(term))
```

A `loss` declaration registers a weighted scalar head in the module's [`LossRegistry`](../api/structural/losses.md#quivers.structural.losses.LossRegistry). The body is compiled as a let-expression closure over an environment: `Enc` and `Dec` resolve to the compiled module's own artifacts, while `term` is supplied by the caller at evaluation time. The `on=decoder(Dec)` option attaches the entry to a named site, so a training driver may evaluate it selectively via [`evaluate_on`](../api/structural/losses.md#quivers.structural.losses.LossRegistry.evaluate_on); `weight=1.0` sets the multiplier applied by [`evaluate`](../api/structural/losses.md#quivers.structural.losses.LossRegistry.evaluate).

## Try it

### Compile, encode, decode

Compile the module with [`quivers.dsl.load`](../api/dsl/parser.md), build a term with [`make_term`](../api/structural/signature.md#quivers.structural.signature.make_term) and [`bound_var`](../api/structural/signature.md#quivers.structural.signature.bound_var), and run it through the round trip.

```python
import torch
from quivers.dsl import load
from quivers.structural import bound_var, make_term

torch.manual_seed(0)
prog = load("docs/examples/source/term_autoencoder.qvr")
enc = prog.encoders["Enc"]
dec = prog.decoders["Dec"]

# \x : base. plus x
term = make_term(
    "Lam",
    make_term("Base", "base"),
    make_term("App", make_term("Const", "plus"), bound_var(0)),
)
code = enc(term)
print("code shape:", tuple(code.shape))     # (24,)

recon = dec(code)
print("reconstruction root op:", recon.op)
```

### Score and train the round trip

[`Decoder.log_prob`](../api/structural/decoder.md#quivers.structural.decoder.Decoder.log_prob) scores an observed term against a code vector; the registry's `evaluate` sums every registered loss under a caller-supplied environment. A few optimizer steps on the encoder and decoder parameters drive the single-term reconstruction loss toward zero.

```python
import torch
from quivers.dsl import load
from quivers.structural import bound_var, make_term

torch.manual_seed(0)
prog = load("docs/examples/source/term_autoencoder.qvr")
enc = prog.encoders["Enc"]
dec = prog.decoders["Dec"]

term = make_term(
    "Lam",
    make_term("Base", "base"),
    make_term("App", make_term("Const", "plus"), bound_var(0)),
)

loss0 = prog.losses.evaluate({"term": term})
params = list(enc.parameters()) + list(dec.parameters())
opt = torch.optim.Adam(params, lr=1e-2)
for _ in range(20):
    opt.zero_grad()
    loss = prog.losses.evaluate({"term": term})
    loss.backward()
    opt.step()
print(f"reconstruction loss: {float(loss0.detach()):.2f} -> {float(loss.detach()):.2f}")
```

Note that the encoder's data-leaf embedding tables allocate parameters lazily on first lookup, so the initial `evaluate` call precedes the optimizer's parameter collection.

## Categorical Perspective

The encoder is a [Σ-algebra homomorphism](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/algebra+over+an+endofunctor) $T_\Sigma \to \mathrm{Vec}_D$: the framework supplies the recursion over the term tree, and the analyst supplies (or accepts scaffolds for) one parametric function per operation. The decoder is a [Kleisli coalgebra](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/coalgebra+over+an+endofunctor) $\mathrm{Vec}_D \to \mathrm{Kern}(T_\Sigma)$, corecursively generating a distribution over terms with a per-term `log_prob`. Their composite is a stochastic endomorphism on $T_\Sigma$, and the loss head scores how far that endomorphism sits from the identity on the observed term.
