# Schema-Bundled Chart Parser

## Overview

A learnable [CKY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYK_algorithm) chart parser assembled from pattern-polymorphic `schema` declarations rather than a `deduction` block. Two binary schemas give forward and backward application (the AB grammar core of the [Lambek calculus](https://doi.org/10.2307/2310058)); one unary schema adds the directional permutation of the commutative Lambek calculus LP. A `bundle` names the rule set, and `parser(...)` splices the bundle into a [`ChartParser`](../api/stochastic/parsers.md#quivers.stochastic.parsers.ChartParser) whose lexical category assignments and per-rule weights are learnable log-weights.

# Schema-Bundled Chart Parser
#
# A learnable CKY chart parser assembled from pattern-polymorphic
# rule schemas over a free residuated category universe, rather
# than from a deduction block. Two binary schemas give forward
# and backward application (the AB grammar core); one unary
# schema adds the directional permutation of the commutative
# Lambek calculus LP. A bundle names the rule set, and
# parser(...) splices the bundle into a differentiable chart
# parser whose lexical category assignments and per-rule weights
# are learnable log-weights.
#
# Rule schemas (X, Y range over Cat):
#
#   fwd_app : X/Y, Y  |- X      forward application
#   bwd_app : Y, X\Y  |- X      backward application
#   perm    : X/Y     |- X\Y    directional permutation (LP)
#
# The chart's category inventory is the depth-1 residuated
# closure of the atoms {N, NP, S}: the atoms plus every A/B and
# A\B with atomic A and B. Token indexes the four-word
# vocabulary {the, dog, cat, sleeps} in declaration order; the
# parser's forward pass scores a token sequence by the inside
# log-weight of the S-rooted span covering the whole input.

object Atoms : {N, NP, S}
object Cat : FreeResiduated(Atoms)
object Token : {the, dog, cat, sleeps}

schema fwd_app (X, Y : Cat) : (X / Y) * Y -> X
schema bwd_app (X, Y : Cat) : Y * (X \ Y) -> X
schema perm (X, Y : Cat) : X / Y -> X \ Y

bundle lp_rules : [fwd_app, bwd_app, perm]

define lp_parser = parser(rules=[lp_rules], terminal=Token, start=S, depth=1)

export lp_parser
```

## Walkthrough

`object Atoms : {N, NP, S}` declares the category atoms as an enum set, and `object Cat : FreeResiduated(Atoms)` binds their [free residuated closure](../semantics/schemas.md#4-the-free-residuated-universe) as the universe the schema parameters range over. `object Token : {the, dog, cat, sleeps}` declares the terminal vocabulary; token indices follow declaration order, so `the` is token 0 and `sleeps` is token 3.

Each `schema` declaration is a family of chart rules parameterized by typed meta-variables ([Schemas](../semantics/schemas.md#6-schema-declarations)). The arity is read off the domain shape: a product domain compiles to a [`PatternBinarySchema`](../api/stochastic/biclosed.md#quivers.stochastic.schema.PatternBinarySchema) that fires on adjacent chart cells, and any other domain compiles to a [`PatternUnarySchema`](../api/stochastic/biclosed.md#quivers.stochastic.schema.PatternUnarySchema) that fires on a single cell. QVR's slash convention is biclosed: in both `X / Y` and `X \ Y` the left operand is the result and the right operand is the argument, with the slash direction marking where the argument is sought. Thus `fwd_app` consumes a rightward functor and its right neighbor, `bwd_app` consumes a leftward functor and its left neighbor, and `perm` flips a functor's seek direction while fixing its result and argument, which is exactly the structural permutation that separates LP from the directional calculus.

`bundle lp_rules : [fwd_app, bwd_app, perm]` binds the rule set as a first-class name ([Bundles](../semantics/schemas.md#7-bundles)). The `parser(...)` expression resolves each entry in `rules=` against declared rules, schema primitives, and bundles; a bundle reference is spliced, that is, replaced by its members exactly as if they had been listed verbatim.

`parser(rules=[lp_rules], terminal=Token, start=S, depth=1)` builds the chart parser via [`ChartParser.from_schema`](../api/stochastic/parsers.md#quivers.stochastic.parsers.ChartParser.from_schema). The category atoms are inferred from the uniquely declared `FreeResiduated` object in scope, and `depth=1` bounds the [`CategorySystem`](../api/stochastic/categories.md#quivers.stochastic.categories.CategorySystem) to the atoms plus every depth-1 slash category, 21 categories in all. Instantiating the three schemas over this inventory yields a [`RuleSystem`](../api/stochastic/rules.md#quivers.stochastic.rules.RuleSystem) with 18 binary and 9 unary firings, each carrying its own learnable log-weight; the lexical axiom contributes a learnable `(4, 21)` token-to-category log-weight table.

## Try it

```python
import torch
from quivers.dsl import load

torch.manual_seed(0)
prog = load("docs/examples/source/schema_chart_parser.qvr")
parser = prog.morphism

print(parser.n_rules, "binary rules;", parser.n_unary_rules, "unary rules")

# token indices: the=0, dog=1, cat=2, sleeps=3
corpus = torch.tensor([[0, 1, 3], [0, 2, 3]])  # the dog sleeps / the cat sleeps
print("initial scores:", parser(corpus))

# LP's permutation is a structural postulate rather than a fitted
# preference, so the corpus adjusts the lexical table and the two
# application rules and leaves the unary weights at their zero
# initialisation.
structural = {id(p) for p in parser.deductions[1].parameters()}
fitted = [p for p in parser.parameters() if id(p) not in structural]

opt = torch.optim.Adam(fitted, lr=5e-2)
for _ in range(40):
    opt.zero_grad()
    loss = -parser(corpus).sum()
    loss.backward()
    opt.step()

print("fitted scores:", parser(corpus))
```

The parser is callable on integer token tensors, `(seq_len,)` for one sentence or `(batch, seq_len)` for a batch, and returns the inside log-weight of the `S`-rooted span covering the whole input. The score is differentiable in the lexical table and the per-rule weights, so fitting the grammar to a corpus is ordinary gradient ascent on the summed scores.

## The chart_fold primitive

`parser(rules=...)` is surface sugar over the `chart_fold(...)` primitive, which builds the same inside computation from morphism-valued arguments instead of named schemas. Given a lexical kernel `emit : NT -> Tok` and a branching kernel `grow : NT -> NT * NT`, `chart_fold` constructs an [`InsideAlgorithm`](../api/stochastic/inside.md#quivers.stochastic.inside.InsideAlgorithm) directly, so the rule tensors are user-declared morphisms rather than schema instantiations:

```qvr
object NT : FinSet 3
object Tok : FinSet 5

morphism grow : NT -> NT * NT
morphism emit : NT -> Tok

define inside = chart_fold(lex=emit, binary=grow, start=0)

export inside
```

This form is the PCFG inside algorithm with `grow[A, B, C]` playing the role of the production probability P(A -> B C) and `emit[A, t]` the emission probability P(A -> t); `start=0` selects the root nonterminal by index.

## Categorical perspective

A schema denotes a uniform family of morphisms indexed by substitutions of its parameters into the residuated universe ([Schemas](../semantics/schemas.md#6-schema-declarations)); instantiating the family over a finite [`CategorySystem`](../api/stochastic/categories.md#quivers.stochastic.categories.CategorySystem) is precisely the evaluation of a functor from category inventories to rule systems, and the union of schemas corresponds to the coproduct of the induced rule systems. Under QVR's biclosed convention `fwd_app` and `bwd_app` are the counits of the right and left residuation adjunctions, and `perm` is the structural isomorphism that a symmetric monoidal (rather than merely monoidal) base makes available. The bundle is denotationally inert: `parser(rules=[lp_rules])` and `parser(rules=[fwd_app, bwd_app, perm])` compile to the same rule system.
