# Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Model

## Overview

A finite [Gaussian mixture model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture_model) treats each observed value as a draw from one of $K$ [Gaussian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution) components. The components share three per-component vector parameters: the mixing weights on the simplex, the component locations, and the component scales. A [Dirichlet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_distribution) prior governs the mixing weights, and independent priors govern the locations and scales.

Rather than sample a discrete per-row component label and integrate it out by hand, this example scores each row directly against the mixture through the [`MixtureNormal`](../api/continuous/families.md#quivers.continuous.families.ConditionalMixtureNormal) likelihood. The per-row marginal is the closed-form convex combination

$$
p(r_n) \;=\; \sum_{k=1}^{K} \mathrm{probs}[k] \; \mathcal{N}\!\bigl(r_n;\, \mu[k],\, \sigma[k]\bigr),
$$

so the model carries no discrete latent: `MixtureNormal` integrates the component assignment out analytically, evaluating the marginal by [log-sum-exp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LogSumExp) over the $K$ components.

# Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Model
#
# A finite Gaussian mixture with K components. Per-component means,
# scales, and mixing weights are latents on the Component plate; each
# observed row is drawn from the resulting mixture. The per-row
# component assignment is integrated out in closed form by the
# MixtureNormal likelihood, so the model carries no discrete latent.
#
# Generative structure:
#
#   probs    ~ Dirichlet(alpha)                    Component-simplex mixing weights
#   mu_k     ~ Normal(0, 5)                        per-component mean
#   sigma_k  ~ HalfNormal(1)                       per-component scale
#   r_n      ~ MixtureNormal(probs, mu, sigma)     observed row
#
# Per-row marginal likelihood (closed form):
#
#   p(r_n) = sum_k probs[k] * Normal(r_n; mu[k], sigma[k]).
#
# MixtureNormal takes three per-component vector parameters (the
# mixing weights, the locations, and the scales), each shared across
# every row of the Resp plate, and scores each row against the
# K-component mixture they define.
#
# Resp is the plate the rows are observed over; Weights is the
# value space of the returned mixing weights, a point of the
# Component simplex embedded in R^K.

## Walkthrough

`composition log_prob [level=algebra]` selects the log-probability semiring so the program's `Score` effect accumulates log-densities additively. `object Component : FinSet 3` and `object Resp : FinSet 100` declare the two discrete plates: $K = 3$ mixture components and $N = 100$ observed rows, and `object Weights : Real 3` is the value space of the returned mixing weights, a point of the component simplex embedded in $\mathbb{R}^K$. `program gmm(alpha : Real) : Resp -> Weights` parameterises the program by the Dirichlet concentration and declares that what it returns is a mixing-weight vector rather than a row index.

The three `sample` steps draw the shared per-component parameters:

- `sample probs <- Dirichlet(alpha) [over=Component]` draws the mixing weights as a single point on the `Component` simplex; `over=Component` names the family's event axis (Dirichlet event-rank 1).
- `sample mu : Component <- Normal(0.0, 5.0)` draws the $K$ component locations as plate-bound continuous latents, one per component.
- `sample sigma : Component <- HalfNormal(1.0)` draws the $K$ positive component scales the same way.

`observe r : Resp <- MixtureNormal(probs, mu, sigma)` scores each observed row against the $K$-component mixture the three shared vectors define. `MixtureNormal` takes the mixing weights, the locations, and the scales as three per-component vectors, each broadcast across every row of the `Resp` plate, and returns the per-row marginal $\sum_k \mathrm{probs}[k]\,\mathcal{N}(r_n;\,\mu[k],\,\sigma[k])$ in closed form. No component-assignment latent is sampled: the mixture likelihood integrates it out.

`return probs` projects the program's joint kernel onto the mixing-weight site.

## Try it

> The short fits below demonstrate the API. Assess convergence with multiple chains and diagnostics before interpreting a posterior.


### Generating synthetic data

```python
import torch
from quivers.dsl import load

torch.manual_seed(0)
prog = load("docs/examples/source/mixture_model.qvr")
fit = prog.gmm(alpha=1.0)
model = fit.morphism

K, N = 3, 100
true_probs = torch.tensor([0.4, 0.35, 0.25])
true_mu    = torch.tensor([-3.0, 0.0, 3.0])
true_sigma = torch.tensor([0.5, 0.7, 0.4])

comps = torch.distributions.Categorical(true_probs).sample((N,))
r     = torch.distributions.Normal(true_mu[comps], true_sigma[comps]).sample()

observations = {"r": r, "probs": true_probs}
x_in = torch.zeros(N, 1)
```

The synthetic rows are drawn by sampling a component per row and then a value from that component's Gaussian, but the model never sees the component labels: only the rows `r` and the fixed mixing weights `probs` enter `observations`. The per-component locations `mu` and scales `sigma` remain unobserved latents and are recovered by SVI.

### SVI fit

```python
from quivers.inference import AutoNormalGuide, ELBO, SVI

torch.manual_seed(1)
guide = AutoNormalGuide(model, observed_names={"r", "probs"})
optim = torch.optim.Adam(
    list(model.parameters()) + list(guide.parameters()), lr=1e-1,
)
svi = SVI(model, guide, optim, ELBO(num_particles=1))

losses = [svi.step(x_in, observations) for _ in range(1200)]
recovered = sorted(guide.loc_mu.detach().flatten().tolist())
print(f"initial loss:    {losses[0]:.2f}")
print(f"final loss:      {losses[-1]:.2f}")
print("recovered means: [" + ", ".join(f"{m:.2f}" for m in recovered) + "]")
print("true means:      [-3.00, 0.00, 3.00]")
```

The variational locations `guide.loc_mu` hold the recovered component means. Because the mixture ELBO is multimodal, the fit is sensitive to initialisation and to the mixing weights held fixed at `probs`; a sharper separation between components makes the locations easier to recover.

### NUTS posterior

```python
from quivers.inference import MCMC, NUTSKernel

torch.manual_seed(2)
kernel = NUTSKernel(step_size=0.05, max_tree_depth=3, target_accept=0.8)
mc     = MCMC(kernel, num_warmup=15, num_samples=15, num_chains=1)
result = mc.run(model, x_in, observations)

print(f"acceptance:  {float(result.acceptance_rates.mean()):.2f}")
print(f"divergences: {int(result.divergence_counts.sum())}")
```


## Categorical perspective

The per-row likelihood `MixtureNormal(probs, mu, sigma)` is a [Kleisli arrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleisli_category) $\mathsf{Resp} \to \mathsf{Resp}$ in the [Giry monad](https://doi.org/10.1007/BFb0092872). It is a finite convex combination of the $K$ Gaussian component measures, weighted by the categorical measure $\mathrm{probs}$ on `Component`: the Giry-monad mixture operation that draws a component from $\mathrm{Categorical}(\mathrm{probs})$, then a value from the chosen Gaussian, and keeps the marginal on the value. Equivalently, `MixtureNormal` is the [pushforward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushforward_measure) of the joint component-and-value measure along the projection $\mathsf{Component} \times \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$, which is exactly the closed-form marginal $\sum_k \mathrm{probs}[k]\,\mathcal{N}(\cdot;\,\mu[k],\,\sigma[k])$. Because the component index is integrated out inside the likelihood rather than sampled, the program carries no discrete latent to marginalise and every site it holds is continuous.
