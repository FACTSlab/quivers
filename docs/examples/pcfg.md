# Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar

## Overview

A [probabilistic context-free grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_context-free_grammar) as an agenda-based weighted deduction over [CKY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYK_algorithm) chart items `span(I, J, N)` under the `LogProb` semiring.

# A PCFG as an agenda-based weighted deduction over CKY chart
# items ``span(I, J, N)`` (token range ``[I, J)`` with
# nonterminal ``N``) under the LogProb semiring. Each production
# is a specific ``rule`` (no free wildcards on the conclusion):
# the chart fires only the productions the grammar licenses, the
# weights are bindings-keyed under ``#[learnable]``, and the
# chart's goal weight at ``span(0, n, S)`` is the corpus inside
# log-probability.

object Term : FinSet 16
object Rule : FinSet 9

object Weight : Real 1

# Probabilistic surface for transpile: each learnable rule weight
# carries an independent Normal(0, 1) prior, and a treebank reports
# how often each rule fired. Exponentiating a weight gives that
# rule's firing rate, so the counts are Poisson in the rate; the
# chart parser downstream consumes the same weights as its per-rule
# log-probabilities. Rule indexes the weight vector, so it is the
# plate extent; the codomain Weight is the value space of the one
# real number a single weight is.
program pcfg_prior : Rule -> Weight
    sample rule_weights : Rule <- Normal(0.0, 1.0)
    let rule_rate = exp(rule_weights)
    observe rule_counts : Rule <- Poisson(rule_rate)
    return rule_weights

## Walkthrough

`object Term : FinSet 16` declares the index set the deduction's domain and codomain range over; the cardinality is incidental, since the chart reasons symbolically over constructor-tagged tuples rather than over enumerated elements. `object Rule : FinSet 9` indexes the rule-weight vector instead: one coordinate per learnable weight, three rules plus six lexicon entries. The `pcfg_prior` program draws that vector from an independent `Normal(0.0, 1.0)` per coordinate, so `Rule` names the axis the weights live on, not the values they take; those come from the family. The program's codomain is `object Weight : Real 1`, the value space of the single real number one weight is, not the index that enumerates the rules. Exponentiating a weight gives that rule's firing rate, so the `rule_counts` plate over `Rule` observes one Poisson count per rule.

The `atoms` block enumerates the constructor universe: nonterminals (`S`, `NP`, `VP`), preterminals (`Det`, `N`, `V`), the chart-item constructor `span`, and the closed-class terminal vocabulary (`the`, `a`, `cat`, `dog`, `sleeps`, `runs`).

The three concrete branching rules declare the grammar's productions one by one. `s_np_vp` combines an `NP` span and an adjacent `VP` span into an `S` span; `np_det_n` combines a `Det` and an `N` into an `NP`; `vp_v` lifts a `V` span to a `VP`. Because each conclusion has no free wildcard, `#[learnable]` allocates one log-weight per rule firing, giving exactly one production probability per rule. Pattern variables `I`, `J`, `K` are single-uppercase identifiers ranging over token positions.

The `lexicon` block ships one entry per closed-class terminal; each `"word" : Cat = lf #[learnable]` line becomes a unit-width `span(I, I+1, Cat)` axiom with the lexical entry's logical form whenever the input token at position `I` matches `"word"`. The semiring is `LogProb`, so inside probabilities accumulate in log space; gradients flow back through the agenda's semiring operations to the learnable weights.

## Try it

```python
from quivers.dsl import load

prog = load("docs/examples/source/pcfg.qvr")
```

To fit per-rule probabilities, wrap the deduction in a [`program`](../guides/dsl-overview.md) that draws lexicon weights from a [Dirichlet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_distribution) prior per preterminal and observes the chart's `chart.goal_weight()` against a corpus of sentences. The `#[learnable]` markers on each lexicon entry expose `nn.Parameter`s the optimizer adjusts; an [`AutoNormalGuide`](../api/inference/guide.md) plus [`SVI`](../api/inference/svi.md) over an [`ELBO`](../api/inference/elbo.md) objective drives the fit. For Viterbi or counting semirings the chart returns a single max-derivation score or a derivation count, which can be conditioned in the same way.

### Generating synthetic data

The `pcfg_prior` program is the standalone Bayesian surface over the same
rule weights. Each rule draws one log-weight from a unit Normal;
exponentiating that weight gives the rate at which the rule fires, and
a treebank reports the count. Drawing the weights from their own prior
and the counts from those weights keeps the synthetic point
self-consistent, so a fit has a ground truth to recover.

```python
import torch
from quivers.dsl import load

torch.manual_seed(0)
prog = load("docs/examples/source/pcfg.qvr")
model = prog.morphism

N_RULES = 9
true_rule_weights = torch.randn(N_RULES)
rule_counts = torch.poisson(torch.exp(true_rule_weights))

observations = {"rule_counts": rule_counts}
x_in = torch.zeros(N_RULES, 1)
```

## Categorical perspective

A PCFG is a weighted deduction in the `LogProb` semiring whose chart is a `K`-valued presheaf over the item algebra `I` of `span(I, J, N)` triples. Branching rules are binary hyperedges in the rule-system hypergraph; anchor rules are unary hyperedges. The least pre-fixed point of the rule-system functor in the `K`-enriched lattice of charts is the inside table; the strategy-independence theorem (Goodman 1999) says CKY-sweep, A\*, and Knuth's algorithm all compute the same chart value. The compiler picks a default strategy from the rule arities and the semiring's algebraic properties.

## Inside computation

The runtime computes chart values through the agenda and supports autodiff through those operations. It exposes no analytic outside pass; gradients come from autodiff over the inside computation.

## Connections to Language Modeling

When the grammar licenses a sentence, `chart.goal_weight()` is its inside score under the chosen semiring. Changing `semiring` selects a different aggregation strategy without changing the rules.
