# Structural autoencoders

This tutorial executes a structural reconstruction loss through the same
entry boundary as an ordinary QIEC computation. The source is the gallery's
[`term_autoencoder.qvr`](../../examples/source/term_autoencoder.qvr), which
declares a typed lambda-term signature, an encoder, a decoder, and a loss.

The important boundary is the **typed attachment path (TAP)**: the stable
module records `Compute` requests and their types, while `Program.run` attaches
the compiled PyTorch modules and preserves their autograd graph.

## 1. Compile and inspect the entries

```python
import torch
from quivers.dsl import load
from quivers.structural import bound_var, make_term

torch.manual_seed(0)
structural = load("docs/examples/source/term_autoencoder.qvr")
names = [entry.name for entry in structural.entry_points()]
assert names == ["Enc", "Dec", "Dec__nll", "reconstruct"]
print(names)
```

`Enc`, `Dec`, and `Dec__nll` are host-computation entries. `reconstruct` is the
loss graph that calls the first and third entries in sequence.

## 2. Construct typed host data

The signature describes simply typed lambda terms. Build
`λx : base. plus x` with the structural host API:

```python
term = make_term(
    "Lam",
    make_term("Base", "base"),
    make_term("App", make_term("Const", "plus"), bound_var(0)),
)
```

`bound_var(0)` refers to the nearest binder. The encoder checks constructors,
argument arities, binder scope, and data vocabulary while it folds the term.

## 3. Invoke the checked loss

```python
run = structural.run("reconstruct", term)
assert torch.is_tensor(run.value)
assert run.value.shape == ()
assert run.result.runtime == "core+structural"

classic_loss = structural.losses.evaluate({"term": term})
torch.testing.assert_close(run.value, classic_loss)
print(float(run.value.detach()))
```

The checked entry and classic loss registry produce the same scalar. The
runtime label names both providers: `core` evaluates the stable computation,
and `structural` handles the encoder and decoder attachments.

## 4. Differentiate through the entry boundary

```python
for parameter in structural.parameters():
    parameter.grad = None

run.value.backward()
assert any(parameter.grad is not None for parameter in structural.parameters())
print(len(structural.state_dict()), "checkpoint tensors")
```

The attachment handler returns a PyTorch tensor without converting it to a
plain scalar, so the autograd edges to both modules survive the reference
machine. The compiled encoder and decoder are registered under stable names;
an optimizer over `structural.parameters()` and a checkpoint from
`structural.state_dict()` thus include them.

## 5. Understand serialization and targets

Serializing `structural.qiec` writes attachment descriptors, stable IDs, and
checked types. It does not serialize the PyTorch modules. A different process
may deserialize the core graph, but it must compile or otherwise attach
compatible encoder and decoder providers before invoking `reconstruct`.

Current probabilistic-programming targets do not carry these neural
attachments. Checking one produces
`qiec:capability:neural-attachment:<entry>`:

```bash
qvr check --target numpyro docs/examples/source/term_autoencoder.qvr
```

This refusal preserves the loss graph. Silently emitting only the source
declarations would suggest that the target can compute a reconstruction value
when it cannot.

The [Term Autoencoder example](../../examples/term-autoencoder.md) develops the
encoder and decoder rules in more detail. The [generated-computation
reference](../../reference/qvr/generated-computations.md#structural-signatures-and-autoencoders)
specifies the attachment boundary.
