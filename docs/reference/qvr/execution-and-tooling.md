# Execution and tooling

Every executable QVR declaration crosses the same **entry boundary (EB)**.
The command line, REPL, TUI, and Python API all list the checked entry, validate
static and value arguments, attach runtime providers, run the evaluator, and
return stable `qiec-run-*` diagnostics through this boundary.

## Check before you run

Parse, compile, and validate one or more files with:

```bash
qvr check model.qvr
qvr check model.qvr other.qvr
qvr check --target stan model.qvr
```

Without `--target`, checking reports parser, constraint, compiler, and QIEC
diagnostics. With a target, it also analyzes the reachable QIEC computation
graph and reports unsupported core capabilities as `qiec:capability:*` or a
more specific QIEC code. This pass does not run the complete renderer, emit
target source, or execute a target toolchain. A successful target check is
thus an early diagnostic, not a guarantee that `qvr transpile` will
accept every surface construct in the module.

Use the same target in the language server:

```bash
qvr lsp --target numpyro
```

The VS Code/Cursor extension exposes it as `qvr.transpileTarget`. LSP clients
may update `transpileTarget` with `workspace/didChangeConfiguration`; the
server rechecks open documents without reparsing them.

## List entry points

```bash
qvr run model.qvr --list
```

The listing distinguishes `computation` entries declared with `define` from
`program` entries and shows value parameters, static binders, residual
effects, result type, and program sites. Omitting both the entry name and
`--list` produces the same listing.

The Python equivalent is:

```python
from quivers.dsl import load

compiled = load("docs/examples/source/bayesian_regression.qvr")
for entry in compiled.entry_points():
    print(entry.name, entry.kind, entry.result)
```

## Run an entry

### Computation arguments

Pass runtime arguments as JSON literals in declaration order:

```bash
qvr run functions.qvr robustify 8.0
qvr run functions.qvr pair 1 '[2.0, 3.0]'
```

Close static binders by name:

```bash
qvr run vectors.qvr total 1.0 2.0 3.0 --static n=3
```

The static value must be a closed type, index, effect application, or integer
for a `Nat` binder. No source variable may remain free.

### Program data and sites

Program parameters may be positional JSON arguments or named `--data`
bindings. `--site` replays one sample site; every unmentioned site is drawn:

```bash
qvr run model.qvr regression \
  --data x='[0.0, 1.0, 2.0]' \
  --data y='[0.1, 1.2, 1.9]' \
  --site slope=0.9 \
  --site intercept=0.1 \
  --site sigma=0.3 \
  --seed 7 \
  --json
```

Each invocation owns its data, observations, sites, generator state, parameter
store, score accumulator, and trace. No handler or mutable provider state is
shared implicitly with the next invocation.

The Python form uses the same names:

<!-- python: skip -->
```python
run = compiled.run(
    "regression",
    data={"x": [0.0, 1.0, 2.0], "y": [0.1, 1.2, 1.9]},
    sites={"slope": 0.9, "intercept": 0.1, "sigma": 0.3},
    seed=7,
)
print(run.value, run.log_joint)
```

`EntryRun.result.trace` contains the same stable events emitted by
`qvr run --trace`; `EntryRun.to_data()` returns the JSON-compatible payload.

## Execution controls

| Option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--seed N` | seed the reference generator for unspecified program sites |
| `--fuel STEPS` | stop a recursive computation after a bounded number of evaluator steps |
| `--trace` | write stable trace events to stderr in plain mode |
| `--json` | emit result, type, runtime, diagnostics, trace, entry kind, and program log joint as JSON |
| `--runtime FILE.json` | select an explicit provider configuration |

Fuel is especially useful for a recursive `define` or generated deduction.
The default is appropriate for ordinary terminating entries; a failed bound
uses `qiec-run-fuel`.

## Runtime providers

The stable core contains identifiers and typed attachment descriptors, never
host callables or mutable objects. A **runtime provider configuration (RPC)**
selects process-local implementations. A configuration has this shape:

```json
{
  "providers": [
    {"name": "core", "options": {}}
  ]
}
```

`core` supplies the reference evaluator, distributions, standard handlers,
search, weights, and parameter lookup. Installed packages may expose another
provider through the `quivers.qiec_runtime` entry-point group. Structural
programs automatically compose the core provider with attachments for their
compiled encoders and decoders when invoked through `Program.run`.

A configuration is non-executable data. It may name a provider and options,
but cannot contain a Python callable. The module and provider are matched by
stable attachment, handler, instance, and operation identifiers before
evaluation begins.

## REPL and TUI

Start an interactive session with `qvr repl model.qvr`. The commands specific
to the entry boundary are:

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `:run` | list entries |
| `:run NAME JSON ...` | invoke a computation |
| `:run NAME --data x=JSON --site z=JSON` | invoke a program |
| `:runtime` | show the active provider configuration |
| `:runtime core` | select a registered provider |
| `:runtime FILE.json` | load a provider configuration |
| `:detach` | detach all runtime providers |
| `:effects NAME` | inspect the inferred row and call contributions |
| `:dump NAME --json` | inspect the checked declaration |

The Textual status bar shows the active runtime and last result. The complete
command and key-binding reference is in [Interactive surface: REPL, kernel,
language server](../../guides/repl-and-lsp.md).

## Language-server features

The QVR LSP uses the same typed source model as the compiler. It provides:

- source-ranged parser, checker, QIEC, and target-capability diagnostics;
- hovers for declarations, calls, operations, instances, and inferred rows;
- definitions, references, and safe renaming for QVR-owned symbols;
- nested document symbols for handler clauses, locals, calls, and program
  scopes;
- context-sensitive completion for operations, names, keywords, built-ins,
  and paths;
- semantic tokens classified by the same rules as the Pygments lexer; and
- canonical formatting through the QVR emitter.

The first-party VS Code/Cursor and Zed extensions start `qvr-lsp`. Neovim and
other clients can launch it over stdio. See [Editor support](../../getting-started/highlighting.md)
for installation and [the LSP capability table](../../guides/repl-and-lsp.md#capabilities)
for method-level details.

## Transpilation

List the exact CLI surface with `qvr transpile --help`, then emit a target with
the target and output options shown there. Check the target first, then run
the transpiler itself:

```bash
qvr check --target pyro model.qvr
qvr transpile --to pyro model.qvr
```

Pyro, NumPyro, PyMC, Edward2, Turing, Gen, WebPPL, and Church emit reachable
QIEC computations through the common runtime ABI. Stan emits the closed,
monomorphic, effect-free scalar fragment as user-defined functions. BUGS and
JAGS accept their measured program subset and refuse unsupported call graphs.
The generated [transpilation support matrix](../../transpile-support.md) is the
authoritative per-feature and per-example report.

## Stable diagnostic families

| Prefix | Boundary |
| --- | --- |
| `parse` | source grammar |
| `compile` and constraint-specific codes | surface resolution and elaboration |
| `qiec-*` | kernel kinding, typing, rows, coverage, and module validation |
| `qiec-run-*` | entry selection, arguments, providers, evaluation, and results |
| `qiec:capability:*` | target cannot represent a reachable checked feature |
| `call:graph:*` | target cannot preserve a reachable call |

Prefer matching the stable code in tests and automation. Human-readable
messages explain the particular source form and may become more specific.

## Grammar ownership and Panproto

Quivers is the source of truth for the current QVR grammar:

- `grammars/qvr/grammar.js` defines the tree-sitter grammar;
- generated parser sources and wheel-native libraries ship with Quivers;
- a manifest verifies that the grammar, generated source, queries, and native
  parser agree; and
- Quivers installs this parser into Panproto's registry before ordinary QVR
  parsing.

`panproto-grammars-all` supplies the other language grammars used by the eleven
transpile targets. Its vendored QVR grammar may lag the Quivers release without
changing how Quivers parses `.qvr` files. Panproto still carries the generic
tree and composes the versioned migration chain. The migration from v0.18 to
the current source protocol is validating and byte-preserving because that
grammar extension was additive.

For editor highlighting, build against the Quivers `grammars/qvr/` directory
or install a first-party extension. Pointing an editor directly at
Panproto's aggregate grammar package may select an older QVR grammar and omit
current tokens.

## Release checklist

Before publishing a module or package:

1. run `qvr check` on every `.qvr` source;
2. run `qvr check --target` for every promised backend;
3. invoke each public entry through `qvr run` or `Program.run` with a small
   fixture;
4. inspect a trace for computations with handlers or random sites;
5. verify editor semantic highlighting with `qvr-lsp` attached; and
6. migrate a copy from the previous source revision when compatibility is part
   of the release claim.
