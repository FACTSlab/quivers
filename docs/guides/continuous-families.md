# Continuous Distribution Families

quivers ships more than forty built-in conditional distribution families. Each
takes an input (the domain) and produces learnable parameters via a
parameter network. This page groups the registry by output shape
and details the families whose event structure interacts with the
[axis-role surface](dsl-programs-and-lets.md#axis-role-clause-over-and-iid_over).
The spaces and base
[`ContinuousMorphism`](../api/continuous/morphisms.md#quivers.continuous.morphisms.ContinuousMorphism)
interface live in [continuous spaces](continuous-spaces.md).

### Hand-written core families

```python
from quivers.continuous.families import (
    ConditionalNormal,
    ConditionalLogitNormal,
    ConditionalBeta,
    ConditionalTruncatedNormal,
    ConditionalDirichlet,
)
from quivers.continuous.spaces import Euclidean
from quivers.core.objects import FinSet
import torch

# Input: finite set X
X = FinSet(name="X", cardinality=5)
domain = Euclidean(name="X", dim=5)        # or FinSet
codomain = Euclidean(name="Y", dim=3)

# Conditional normal: learns linear maps mu(x), log_sigma(x)
normal = ConditionalNormal(domain, codomain)

# Sample from p(y | x)
x = torch.randn(8, 5)                              # batch of 8 inputs
samples = normal.rsample(x, sample_shape=torch.Size((100,)))  # (100, 8, 3)

# Log probability
y = torch.randn(8, 3)
log_p = normal.log_prob(x, y)  # shape (8,)
```

### Loc-scale families

Standard reparameterizable distributions with learned location and
scale:

)
```

)
from quivers.continuous.spaces import Euclidean

domain = Euclidean(name="X", dim=5)
codomain = Euclidean(name="Y", dim=3)
x = torch.randn(8, 5)

gamma = ConditionalGamma(domain, codomain)
samples = gamma.rsample(x)  # positive
```

    ConditionalBeta,
    ConditionalKumaraswamy,
    ConditionalContinuousBernoulli,
)
```

    ConditionalMultivariateNormal,
    ConditionalLowRankMVN,
    ConditionalDirichlet,
    ConditionalWishart,
    ConditionalInverseWishart,
    ConditionalMatrixNormal,

mvn = ConditionalMultivariateNormal(domain, Euclidean(name="Y", dim=5))
```

```python
from quivers.continuous.families import (
    ConditionalBernoulli,
    ConditionalCategorical,
    ConditionalRelaxedBernoulli,
    ConditionalRelaxedOneHotCategorical,
)
```

## Event rank and the axis-role surface

`event_rank` per family controls the
[axis-role surface in the DSL](dsl-programs-and-lets.md#axis-role-clause-over-and-iid_over):

| Family | Event rank | Categorical reading |
|---|---|---|
| `Normal`, `Beta`, `Gamma`, `Exponential`, `LogNormal`, `LogitNormal`, `Cauchy`, `Laplace`, `Gumbel`, `StudentT`, `Weibull`, `Pareto`, `Kumaraswamy`, `ContinuousBernoulli`, `HalfNormal`, `HalfCauchy`, `InverseGamma`, `TruncatedNormal`, `Uniform`, `Bernoulli` | 0 | Scalar; every codomain axis is iid by default |
| `MultivariateNormal`, `LowRankMVN`, `Dirichlet`, `OneHotCategorical`, `RelaxedOneHotCategorical`, `LogisticNormal`, `GP`, `Horseshoe` | 1 | Vector; one named event axis carries the joint distribution |
| `Wishart`, `InverseWishart`, `MatrixNormal`, `LKJCholesky` | 2 | Matrix; two named event axes carry the joint distribution |

The DSL surface `~ Family over <axes>` requires the axis count to
match the family's event rank exactly; mismatch is a compile-time
error. In particular, a flat MVN over $\dim(A) \cdot \dim(B)$
(dense covariance, event_rank 1 with a single named axis whose dim
equals the product) is categorically distinct from a `MatrixNormal`
over `(A, B)` (Kronecker structure $V \otimes U$, event_rank 2);
the surface keeps the two distinguishable rather than
auto-substituting.

## Structured priors over weight matrices

### MatrixNormal: Kronecker-covariance matrix prior

```python
from quivers.continuous.families import ConditionalMatrixNormal
from quivers.continuous.spaces import Euclidean

domain = Euclidean(name="X", dim=5)

# Matrix-valued kernel: domain -> R^(rows*cols), with samples
# reshaped to (rows, cols) and Kronecker covariance Sigma = V (x) U.
mn = ConditionalMatrixNormal(
    domain, Euclidean(name="W", dim=4 * 8), rows=4, cols=8
)
```

The
[matrix-Normal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_normal_distribution)
`MN(M, U, V)` is the natural prior for a weight matrix $W :
\mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}^k$ whose row and column correlations
factor separately. When used as a latent-morphism prior in the
DSL — `morphism W : Euclidean(D) -> Euclidean(K) [role=latent,
over=[dom, cod]] ~ MatrixNormal(loc, row_scale, col_scale)` — the
first axis listed in `over` binds the row covariance and the
second the column covariance.

### InverseWishart: conjugate covariance prior

```python
from quivers.continuous.families import ConditionalInverseWishart
from quivers.continuous.spaces import Euclidean

domain = Euclidean(name="X", dim=5)

# Conjugate prior on a d-dim covariance matrix.  Realized as the
# inversion of a Wishart sample with the correct symmetric-matrix
# change-of-variables Jacobian.
d = 4
iw = ConditionalInverseWishart(domain, Euclidean(name="Sigma", dim=d))
```

Conjugate prior for the covariance of a multivariate normal
([Gelman, Carlin, Stern, Dunson, Vehtari, Rubin 2013](https://doi.org/10.1201/b16018), §3.6).
The change-of-variables Jacobian for inverting a positive-definite
symmetric matrix contributes a `-(d + 1) log det(Sigma)` term to
the log-density.

### LKJCholesky: correlation-matrix prior

```python
from quivers.continuous.families import ConditionalLKJCholesky
from quivers.continuous.spaces import Euclidean

domain = Euclidean(name="X", dim=5)
d = 4

lkj = ConditionalLKJCholesky(
    domain, Euclidean(name="L", dim=d),
)
```

[LKJ-distributed](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmva.2009.04.008)
Cholesky factors on the manifold of correlation matrices. The
matrix dimension comes from `codomain.dim`; the concentration
parameter is learned from the input by the family's parameter
network (concentration 1 gives the uniform distribution over
correlation matrices).

### Wishart

```python
from quivers.continuous.families import ConditionalWishart
from quivers.continuous.spaces import Euclidean

domain = Euclidean(name="X", dim=5)
d = 4

wishart = ConditionalWishart(
    domain, Euclidean(name="Sigma", dim=d),
)
```

## Non-parametric and structured families

### ConditionalGaussianProcess

A [Gaussian
process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_process) on
$\mathbb{R}^D$ is a Markov kernel $X^N \to \mathcal{G}(\mathbb{R}^N)$
whose value at any finite collection of input locations
$x_1, \dots, x_N \in \mathbb{R}^D$ is a joint multivariate Normal
with covariance $K(x_i, x_j)$. Categorically, the family departs
from the other parametric families: its "parameters" at each
evaluation are the input locations themselves, not a small
neural-net summary of them.
[`ConditionalGaussianProcess`](../api/continuous/families.md#quivers.continuous.families.ConditionalGaussianProcess)
exposes three covariance kernels (RBF, Matern 5/2, linear) with
learnable length scale and amplitude.

```python
from quivers.continuous.families import ConditionalGaussianProcess
from quivers.continuous.spaces import Euclidean
import torch

D, N = 2, 8
gp = ConditionalGaussianProcess(
    Euclidean(name="X", dim=D),
    Euclidean(name="Y", dim=N),
    kernel="rbf",
    length_scale=0.5,
    amplitude=1.0,
)
x = torch.randn(N, D)            # N input locations in R^D
f = gp.rsample(x)                # one GP draw at those inputs, shape (N,)
log_p = gp.log_prob(x, f)        # MVN(0, K(x, x) + jitter * I) density
```

The DSL registers the family as `GP` with event rank 1; one named
axis (the input-location count $N$) carries the joint distribution.

### ConditionalHorseshoe

The [horseshoe prior](https://doi.org/10.1093/biomet/asq017) is a
sparse-signal prior whose hierarchical form is

$$
\begin{aligned}
\tau &\sim \mathrm{HalfCauchy}(\text{scale}) \\
\lambda_d &\sim \mathrm{HalfCauchy}(1) \quad \text{for } d = 1, \dots, D \\
\beta_d \mid \tau, \lambda_d &\sim \mathcal{N}\!\bigl(0, (\tau \lambda_d)^2\bigr).
\end{aligned}
$$

The marginal density of $\beta_d$ after integrating the local scale
$\lambda_d$ has no elementary closed form.
[`ConditionalHorseshoe`](../api/continuous/families.md#quivers.continuous.families.ConditionalHorseshoe)
approximates the marginal with 16-point
[Gauss-Legendre quadrature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Legendre_quadrature)
after the change of variables $\lambda = \tan(\pi t / 2)$ which
maps $(0, \infty)$ to $(0, 1)$ with Jacobian
$(\pi / 2) \sec^2(\pi t / 2)$.

```python
import torch
from quivers.continuous.families import ConditionalHorseshoe
from quivers.continuous.spaces import Euclidean
from quivers.core.objects import FinSet

hs = ConditionalHorseshoe(
    FinSet(name="A", cardinality=4),
    Euclidean(name="beta", dim=10),
    scale=0.1,
)
x = torch.tensor([0, 1, 2, 3])
beta = hs.rsample(x)             # shape (4, 10)
log_p = hs.log_prob(x, beta)     # shape (4,), summed over coordinates
```

The DSL registers the family as `Horseshoe` with event rank 1; the
one named axis carries the per-coordinate marginal product.

### Choosing among multivariate priors

| Goal | Family | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Generic multivariate posterior with dense covariance | `ConditionalMultivariateNormal` | Standard; learnable Cholesky factor. |
| Weight matrix with separable row / column correlations | `ConditionalMatrixNormal` | Kronecker structure $V \otimes U$ has $r^2 + c^2$ params instead of $(rc)^2$. |
| Covariance prior for a downstream MVN | `ConditionalInverseWishart` | Places a distribution on positive-definite covariance matrices. |
| Correlation matrix in a hierarchical model | `ConditionalLKJCholesky` | Prior on correlations alone, leaving scales free. |
| Non-parametric regression with smoothness control | `ConditionalGaussianProcess` | Prior over functions; bandwidth from kernel length-scale. |
| Sparse signal selection (e.g. variable selection in regression) | `ConditionalHorseshoe` | Strong shrinkage toward zero with heavy tails for large signals. |
