# Monadic Programs

## What is a MonadicProgram?

A
[`MonadicProgram`](../api/continuous/programs.md#quivers.continuous.programs.MonadicProgram)
is a probabilistic program specified as a sequence of bind and let
steps. It defines a
[`ContinuousMorphism`](../api/continuous/morphisms.md#quivers.continuous.morphisms.ContinuousMorphism)
from a domain to a codomain via [monadic
composition](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Kleisli+category)
(Kleisli bind).

The program syntax mirrors probabilistic programming languages
(Pyro, NumPyro, Stan):

<!-- compile: false -->
```qvr
program name : domain -> codomain
    sample x_1 <- morphism_1
    sample x_2 <- morphism_2(x_1)
    let y = x_1 + x_2
    observe z <- morphism_3(y)
    return y
```

Each `sample ... <- ...` step draws from a conditional distribution
and binds the result. The `observe` keyword conditions the program on
an external observation.

## Program structure

A program is an
[`nn.Module`](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Module.html)
that, when called, executes forward ancestral sampling:

```python
from quivers.continuous import Draw, MonadicProgram
from quivers.continuous.families import ConditionalNormal
from quivers.continuous.spaces import Euclidean
from quivers.core.objects import FinSet
import torch

Unit = FinSet(name="Unit", cardinality=1)
R1 = Euclidean(name="R1", dim=1)

prior      = ConditionalNormal(Unit, R1)            # x ~ Normal(0, 1)
likelihood = ConditionalNormal(R1, R1)              # y ~ Normal(x, 1)

program = MonadicProgram(
    Unit,
    R1,
    steps=[
        Draw(names=("x",), morphism=prior),  # x <- prior
        Draw(names=("y",), morphism=likelihood, args=("x",)),  # y <- likelihood(x)
    ],
    return_vars=("y",),
)

# Forward pass: sampling
samples = program.rsample(
    torch.zeros(4, dtype=torch.long), sample_shape=torch.Size([100])
)  # shape (100, 4, 1)

# Log joint: sum_i log p(z_i | pa(z_i)) given every bound variable
x_val = torch.randn(4, 1)
y_val = torch.randn(4, 1)
log_joint = program.log_joint(
    torch.zeros(4, dtype=torch.long),
    {"x": x_val, "y": y_val},
)
```

## Bind steps

A bind step `sample x <- f` or `sample x <- f(y, z)` samples from a morphism,
optionally conditioned on previous variables.

Single bind:

<!-- compile: false -->
```qvr
sample x <- prior_f
```

Conditioned bind:

<!-- compile: false -->
```qvr
sample y <- likelihood_f(x)
```

Destructuring tuple bind (stacked along feature dimension):

<!-- compile: false -->
```qvr
sample (x, y) <- joint_f(z, w)
```

The variable names on the left side are bound in the environment.
An indexed bind `sample v : A <- F(args)` declares `v` as an
$A$-indexed plate of independent draws.

## Let steps

Deterministic binding:

<!-- compile: false -->
```qvr
let x = y + z
let weight = 0.5
```

Supports literals, variable references, arithmetic, and the
let-expression primitive surface; see
[DSL Programs and Let-Expressions](dsl-programs-and-lets.md#let-expressions-arithmetic-primitives-and-collections)
for the full primitive list.

## Observe keyword

Condition the program on an observation:

<!-- compile: false -->
```qvr
observe y <- likelihood(x)
```

This marks `y` as conditioned. During inference, observations
clamp these variables to external values. An indexed-observe
`observe r : N <- F(args)` accumulates a batched likelihood over
the index set `N`, with the response buffer supplied via the
runtime `observations` dict.

## Return statement

Specify the program output. Single or tuple:

<!-- compile: false -->
```qvr
return x
```

<!-- compile: false -->
```qvr
return (x, y, z)
```

The return value's shape determines the codomain. Tuples are
bare-positional; the resulting product space's components are
ordered by tuple position.

## Domains and codomains

Domains can be:

- A single [`FinSet`](../api/core/objects.md) or
  [`ContinuousSpace`](../api/continuous/spaces.md).
- A product of sets / spaces: `X * Y * Z`.
- Named parameters: the domain is the product, but variables can
  refer to sub-components.

Codomains are determined by the return statement shape.

## rsample and log_joint

Two key operations on a compiled program:

### rsample(x, sample_shape=(), observations=None)

Generate samples by executing the program:

```python
x = torch.zeros(5, dtype=torch.long)
samples = program.rsample(x, sample_shape=torch.Size([1000]))
# shape: (1000, 5, codomain_dim)
```

Sequential ancestral sampling: each draw step samples, previous
draws are available to subsequent steps. `observations` is an
optional `dict[str, torch.Tensor]` clamping observed sites to
runtime data.

### log_joint(x, intermediates)

Compute $\log p(z_1, \ldots, z_k \mid x) = \sum_i \log p(z_i \mid
\mathrm{pa}(z_i))$ given all bound-variable values:

<!-- python: skip -->
```python
x = torch.randn(5)
intermediates = {"z": z_value, "y": y_value}  # every bound variable

log_pjoint = program.log_joint(x, intermediates)
```

`log_joint` is the core kernel summed across the program's draw /
plate-draw / observe steps, used inside
[`ELBO.forward`](../api/inference/elbo.md#quivers.inference.objectives.ELBO)
after the guide samples latents.

### The `observations` dict

Indexed-observe steps (`observe r : N <- F(args)`) read their
response buffers from a runtime
`observations: dict[str, torch.Tensor]`, keyed by the
observed-variable name. The dict is passed as the `observations`
kwarg to
[`MonadicProgram.rsample`](../api/continuous/programs.md#quivers.continuous.programs.MonadicProgram.rsample)
and as the final positional argument to
[`ELBO.forward`](../api/inference/elbo.md#quivers.inference.objectives.ELBO) /
[`SVI.step`](../api/inference/svi.md#quivers.inference.svi.SVI.step):

<!-- python: skip -->
```python
observations = {
    "cloze_resp": cloze_tensor,    # shape (n_cloze_resp,)
    "prop_resp":  prop_tensor,     # shape (n_prop_resp,)
}

samples = program.rsample(x, observations=observations)
loss = elbo(model, guide, x, observations)
```

There is no `.qvr`-level data block; the tensor sources live in
Python at the call site, and the keys must match the response
identifiers declared in the program body.

## Named parameters

If the domain is a product, name the components via the `params`
argument so steps can reference them by name:

<!-- python: skip -->
```python
A = FinSet(name="A", cardinality=3)
B = FinSet(name="B", cardinality=4)
Z = FinSet(name="Z", cardinality=5)

program = MonadicProgram(
    A * B,
    Z,
    steps=[
        Draw(names=("x",), morphism=f, args=("a", "b")),  # x <- f(a, b)
    ],
    return_vars=("x",),
    params=("a", "b"),
)
```

The program splits the product input along the feature axis at
runtime and binds each slice to the corresponding name in `params`.

## Example: a simple model

```python
import torch
from quivers.continuous import Draw, MonadicProgram
from quivers.continuous.families import (
    ConditionalNormal,
    ConditionalLogitNormal,
)
from quivers.continuous.spaces import Euclidean
from quivers.core.objects import FinSet

Unit = FinSet(name="Unit", cardinality=1)
R1 = Euclidean(name="R1", dim=1)
R2 = Euclidean(name="R2", dim=2)

prior_mu    = ConditionalNormal(Unit, R1)
prior_sigma = ConditionalLogitNormal(Unit, R1)
likelihood  = ConditionalNormal(R2, R1)

program = MonadicProgram(
    Unit,
    R1,
    steps=[
        Draw(names=("mu",), morphism=prior_mu),
        Draw(names=("sigma",), morphism=prior_sigma),
        Draw(names=("y",), morphism=likelihood, args=("mu", "sigma")),
    ],
    return_vars=("y",),
)

# Use for inference
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(program.parameters())
```

## Destructuring binds

Extract multiple values from a tuple-returning sub-program:

<!-- compile: false -->
```qvr
program sub : X -> Y * Y
    sample (a, b) <- some_morphism
    return (a, b)

program main : X -> Z
    sample (u, v) <- sub
    sample w <- g(u, v)
    return w
```

The pattern `sample (u, v) <- sub` destructures the output.

## Observation clamping

During inference, the
[`condition()`](../api/inference/conditioning.md#quivers.inference.conditioning.condition)
function clamps observations:

```python
from quivers.inference import condition

# Condition program on external observations
observed_y = torch.tensor([1.0, -0.5, 2.0])

conditioned = condition(program, {"y": observed_y})

# Trace under the conditioning: observed sites are clamped to the data
x = torch.zeros(3, dtype=torch.long)
tr = conditioned.trace(x)
```

## Product domains and outputs

For multiple domain inputs, stack along the feature dimension:

<!-- compile: false -->
```qvr
program f(x_val, y_val) : (X * Y) -> Z
    sample z <- g(x_val, y_val)
    return z
```

The bare-identifier parameters `x_val`, `y_val` name the
projections of the product domain. Internally, the domain tensor
is reshaped to match.

## Building programs in Python

Every program the DSL compiles is assembled from objects the
[`quivers.continuous`](../api/continuous/programs.md) package exports, so
a program can be built in Python without writing QVR source. The step
records are the contract:

| Record | Source form | Fields |
|---|---|---|
| [`Draw`](../api/continuous/program_steps.md#quivers.continuous.program_steps.Draw) | `sample x <- f(a, b)` | `names`, `morphism`, `args` |
| [`Observe`](../api/continuous/program_steps.md#quivers.continuous.program_steps.Observe) | `observe y <- f(a, b)` | `names`, `morphism`, `args` |
| [`Let`](../api/continuous/program_steps.md#quivers.continuous.program_steps.Let) | `let w = expression` | `name`, `value` |
| [`Score`](../api/continuous/program_steps.md#quivers.continuous.program_steps.Score) | a `marginalize` block | `name`, `score` |

A draw's `args` are binding names, or
[`Indexed`](../api/continuous/program_steps.md#quivers.continuous.program_steps.Indexed)
gathers such as `mu[group]`; `None` reads the program input. A let's
`value` is a constant, the name of an earlier binding, or a function
of the environment, which may declare the names it reads through
[`reading`](../api/continuous/program_steps.md#quivers.continuous.program_steps.reading).
The morphisms are the ones the compiler emits: a fixed-parameter
family comes from a `make_fixed_*` factory such as
[`make_fixed_normal`](../api/continuous/inline.md#quivers.continuous.inline.make_fixed_normal);
a family whose parameters are bindings is a
[`MixedInlineDistribution`](../api/continuous/inline.md#quivers.continuous.inline.MixedInlineDistribution)
over the stacked arguments; an indexed draw `sample v : A <- F(...)` is a
[`PlateDraw`](../api/continuous/plate.md#quivers.continuous.plate.PlateDraw)
of one draw per element of `A`; and an indexed observe is a
[`VectorisedObserve`](../api/continuous/plate.md#quivers.continuous.plate.VectorisedObserve).

The program below is a hierarchical Normal model with one mean per
group, built twice: once from source, and once from the records. The
two score every value identically.

```python
import torch
import torch.distributions as D

from quivers.continuous import (
    Draw,
    Euclidean,
    Indexed,
    MixedInlineDistribution,
    MonadicProgram,
    Observe,
    PlateDraw,
    ProductSpace,
    VectorisedObserve,
    make_fixed_halfnormal,
    make_fixed_normal,
)
from quivers.core import FinSet, Unit
from quivers.dsl import loads

compiled = loads("""
object Group : FinSet 3
object Row : FinSet 6
object Val : Real 1

program model : Row -> Val
    sample mu : Group <- Normal(loc=0.0, scale=1.0)
    sample sigma <- HalfNormal(scale=1.0)
    let m = mu[group]
    observe y : Row <- Normal(loc=m, scale=sigma)
    return y

export model
""").morphism

Row = FinSet(name="Row", cardinality=6)
Val = Euclidean(name="Val", dim=1)

likelihood = MixedInlineDistribution(
    ProductSpace(components=(Val, Val)),
    Val,
    param_spec=[("var", 1), ("var", 1)],
    dist_builder=lambda params: D.Normal(params[0], params[1]),
)
built = MonadicProgram(
    Row,
    Val,
    steps=[
        # sample mu : Group <- Normal(0, 1), one mean per group
        Draw(
            names=("mu",),
            morphism=PlateDraw(3, make_fixed_normal(0.0, 1.0, Val), domain=Unit),
        ),
        # sample sigma <- HalfNormal(1)
        Draw(names=("sigma",), morphism=make_fixed_halfnormal(1.0, Val)),
        # observe y : Row <- Normal(mu[group], sigma)
        Observe(
            names=("y",),
            morphism=VectorisedObserve(likelihood, torch.zeros(6)),
            args=(Indexed(name="mu", indices=("group",)), "sigma"),
        ),
    ],
    return_vars=("y",),
)

values = {
    "mu": torch.randn(3, 1),
    "sigma": torch.rand(1, 1) + 0.5,
    "y": torch.randn(6),
    "group": torch.tensor([0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]),
}
x = torch.arange(6)
torch.testing.assert_close(compiled.log_joint(x, values), built.log_joint(x, values))
```

A group-level correlation structure follows the same pattern. A
`PlateDraw` over an LKJ prior on Cholesky factors draws one factor per
group, whether the prior is the inline family
([`make_fixed_lkj_cholesky`](../api/continuous/inline.md#quivers.continuous.inline.make_fixed_lkj_cholesky))
or the [`LKJCorrelationFactor`](../api/continuous/families.md#quivers.continuous.families.LKJCorrelationFactor)
morphism:

```python
from quivers.continuous import CholeskyFactor, make_fixed_lkj_cholesky

factors = PlateDraw(
    3, make_fixed_lkj_cholesky(2.0, CholeskyFactor(name="L", dim=4)), domain=Unit
)
draw = factors.rsample(torch.zeros(1, dtype=torch.long))  # (3, 16): one factor per group
reference = D.LKJCholesky(4, torch.tensor(2.0)).log_prob(draw.reshape(3, 4, 4)).sum()
torch.testing.assert_close(factors.log_prob(torch.zeros(1), draw).squeeze(), reference)
```

## Integration with the DSL

MonadicPrograms are the output of `.qvr` DSL compilation. The DSL
parser translates:

<!-- compile: false -->
```qvr
object X : FinSet 3
object Y : FinSet 4
program my_prog : X -> Y
    sample mu <- LogitNormal(mu=0, sigma=1)
    sample x <- Normal(loc=mu, scale=1)
    return x

export my_prog
```

into a `MonadicProgram` instance that can be trained. The full DSL
surface for programs lives in
[DSL Programs and Let-Expressions](dsl-programs-and-lets.md).
