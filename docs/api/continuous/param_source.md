# Parameter Sources

`quivers.continuous.param_source` maps a conditional family's input to
its distribution parameters. For a morphism declared `~ Family` over a
continuous domain, a `ParamSource` computes the parameters of the
corresponding Kleisli arrow. Nonlinear dependence on the input is thus
implemented by the parameter source.

`LinearSource` contains one `nn.Linear`. `MLPSource` is a multilayer
perceptron with configurable widths and activation, while
`AttentionSource` is a self-attention head. `LookupSource` and
`EmbeddingSource` handle discrete domains. `IdentitySource`,
`FunctionSource`, and `ComposeSource` implement pass-through, a fixed
callable, and source composition, respectively.

Families call the `make_param_source` factory, and
`param_source_from_option` parses the DSL's `[param_source=<kind>]`
morphism option. The default for a continuous domain is `LinearSource`,
so a kernel is linear unless another source is requested. A `SetObject`
domain uses `LookupSource` regardless of the requested kind. The
[Bayesian Neural Network](../../examples/bnn.md) example selects the
MLP source explicitly and relies on it for its nonlinearity.

The hidden widths come either from the option's arguments or from
`hidden_dim`, one width per hidden layer:

<!-- compile: false -->
```qvr
morphism f : X -> Y [param_source=mlp] ~ Normal                      # (64, 64)
morphism f : X -> Y [param_source=mlp(64, 32)] ~ Normal              # (64, 32)
morphism f : X -> Y [param_source=mlp, hidden_dim=[64, 32]] ~ Normal # (64, 32)
morphism f : X -> Y [param_source=mlp, hidden_dim=64] ~ Normal       # (64,)
```

A width given to a source with no hidden layers to apply it to is an
error rather than a silent no-op, and so is `param_source` on a family
whose parameters do not come from a source at all (`Horseshoe`,
`GaussianProcess`, `Independent`, `Transformed`).
