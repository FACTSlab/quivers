"""Reparameterization strategies as effect handlers.

A `Reparam` strategy rewrites a sample site: given the site's sampleable
it produces the value the site takes and the density the site
contributes, according to a bijection that preserves the induced
distribution while reshaping the geometry downstream inference sees.
The canonical use case is HMC on funnel geometries: reparameterising
``y ~ Normal(0, exp(z))`` into ``y_raw ~ Normal(0, 1); y = exp(z) *
y_raw`` decouples the tight scale-location dependency that would
otherwise kill NUTS
([Betancourt and Girolami 2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.0906)).

The `ReparamOrchestrator` handler of the program's ``random`` instance
answers each covered site with its strategy's value and emits the
strategy's density as the site's score; every other site forwards, its
sampleable remembered so a strategy of a later site may read it. A user
writes

    with reparam({"theta": LocScaleReparam(), "z": NeuTraReparam(guide)}):
        samples = nuts.run(model, x, observations)

and has per-site strategies apply in one pass.
