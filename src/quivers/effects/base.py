"""Effect handlers for probabilistic programs, as lexical kernel handlers.

A `MonadicProgram` runs on the reference machine as the kernel
computation :mod:`quivers.effects.program_module` encodes it to, whose
sites are ``Random.sample`` requests on the program's ``random`` instance
and whose densities are ``Score.add`` requests on its ``score`` instance.
An `EffectHandler` is a description of a handler of one of those
instances: entering it as a context manager pushes it on a thread-local
stack, and `quivers.effects.interpreter.run_program` installs every
handler on the stack as a lexical handler around the program, in the
order the stack gives, so the composition rules are the kernel's own.
The design descends from the Pyro ``poutine`` and NumPyro ``handlers``
shape ([Pyro poutine docs](https://docs.pyro.ai/en/stable/poutine.html))
and from the operational account of handlers in
[Plotkin and Pretnar (2009)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-00590-9_7);
its application to probabilistic programming follows
[Scibior et al. (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1145/3236778).

Two rules govern how a stack composes. A handler of the ``random``
instance sees a site's request before any handler outside it, and sees
the outer answer flow back through its resumption, so an inner trace
records what an outer clamp or intervention decided. The density a site
contributes is a ``Score.add`` the answering handler emits outward, so
every handler of the ``score`` instance on the stack transforms every
site's density on its way to the run's accumulator, and a trace reads a
site's density from what reached the accumulator under that site's
provenance.
