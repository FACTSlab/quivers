"""Trace handler: records every site the program visits.

`TraceHandler` installs an observing handler of the program's ``random``
instance and of its let and score steps at its position on the stack, so
it records each site's value as the handlers outside it answered it and
sees no site a handler inside it hid. A site's density is read after the
run from the contributions that reached the run's accumulator under the
site's provenance, after every score transformer on the stack. The thin
`quivers.inference.trace.trace` wrapper stacks this handler on and returns
its accumulated `Trace`.
