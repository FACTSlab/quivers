"""Standard arrow instances for the typeclass tower.

Implements the arrow interfaces of :mod:`quivers.arrows.typeclasses`
against the V-enriched category of finite sets. Each instance carries
no per-instance state — every operation is a stateless construction
on the underlying :class:`Morphism` algebra. The instances register
themselves against the relevant ABCs (``Arrow``, ``ArrowChoice``,
``ArrowApply``, ``ArrowLoop``) so :func:`isinstance` works
transparently for the chart-parser's arrow-side dispatch.

Realisations:

- :class:`VRel` — the canonical V-enriched-relation arrow. ``compose``
  is the V-Rel ``>>`` operator; ``arr`` is the identity embedding;
  ``first`` is the parallel-product factory; ``left_arr`` is the
  coproduct functorial action; ``loop_arr`` is the V-algebra iterative
  trace on the recurrent component.
- :class:`Function` — restricts to deterministic V-relations (functions
  with point-mass tensors). Pure-functional operations.
- :class:`Stochastic` — Stochastic-matrix arrows where ``first``,
  ``left_arr``, and ``loop_arr`` are the corresponding row-stochastic
  realisations.
