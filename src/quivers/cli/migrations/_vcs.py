"""VCS integration helpers for the migration system.

The panproto VCS at ``grammars/qvr/vcs/.panproto/`` carries one commit
per distinct grammar revision. This module wraps the panproto Python
API to drive three integration points used by the rest of the
migrations package:

* `diff_coverage` -- for an adjacent hop, computes the
  panproto schema diff and reports any source rule that the
  hop's declared converters do not cover. Used by
  `check_chain_coverage` and exposed via ``qvr migrate --check``.
* `blame_kind` -- given a tree-sitter rule name (vertex kind),
  reports the commit and tag that first introduced or last carried
  that rule. Used by the migrator's error reporter when an unknown
  source vertex kind is encountered.
* `commit_id_for` -- resolves a release name (``"v0.10.0"``,
  ``"HEAD"``) to its panproto VCS commit id, so converters and the
  CLI can index by content-hash and survive tag renames.
