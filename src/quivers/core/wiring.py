"""Operadic n-ary tensor contractions for V-enriched categories.

A :class:`CompositionRule` defines **binary** composition:
``(f >> g)[i, k] = ⋁_j f[i, j] ⊗ g[j, k]``. That covers the
2-cells of a 2-category. Useful but narrow — many models combine
three or more tensors at a shared reduction (e.g. two argument
tensors plus a kernel folded at a single contraction):

    out[s, c] = ⋁_{p, q} (
        arg1[s, p] ⊗ arg2[s, q] ⊗ kernel[p, q, c]
    )

This isn't expressible as a chain of binary ``>>``: it's an
n-input wiring diagram whose centre contracts two axes at once
under a fixed tensor_op and join. The general framework is
**operads** / **wiring diagrams** (Spivak 2014); this module
exposes a Python surface for them.

The unifying construct is :class:`WiringRule`: an n-ary
generalization of binary composition that pairs a
:class:`CompositionRule` (supplying ``tensor_op`` and ``join``)
with an einsum-style wiring spec naming which input axes are
contracted vs preserved.

Categorically a ``WiringRule`` is a single operation of a
colored operad whose colors are the V-Cat object types; the
:class:`CompositionRule` supplies the operad's enriching algebra.

    Spec syntax::

        "input_1, input_2, ..., input_n -> output"

    where each ``input_i`` and ``output`` is a sequence of axis
    letters identifying which dimensions of that tensor align.
    Axes that appear in some input but not in the output are
    contracted (reduced via the composition rule's ``join``);
    axes that appear in the output are preserved (broadcast as
    needed).

    Examples::

        EinsumWiring(product_fuzzy, "ij, jk -> ik")
            # binary composition: contract over j, preserve (i, k)
        EinsumWiring(product_fuzzy, "sp, sq, pqo -> so")

            # (s, *) and a kernel contracted over (p, q),
            # preserving (s, o)

    The contraction algorithm:

    1. Determine the universe of axis letters from inputs and output.
    2. Broadcast each input tensor against the full axis universe
       (singleton dims for axes the input doesn't carry).
    3. Fold all broadcast inputs with ``tensor_op`` (left fold).
    4. Reduce over the contracted axes using ``join``.
    5. Permute to the output's letter order.

    Steps 3-4 correspond to the categorical content; steps 1, 2,
    and 5 are the einsum bookkeeping that places axes in a common
    shape so the binary ``tensor_op`` can fold over the n inputs.
