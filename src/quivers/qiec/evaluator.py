"""Small-step reference evaluator for the Quivers Indexed Effect Core.

The evaluator is deliberately an interpreter, not an optimized execution
engine.  It gives ``Return``, ``Bind``, ``Perform``, and ``Handle`` one
operational meaning against which lowerings and backend runtimes can be tested.
Core terms remain serializable: host values and executable handler clauses live
only in :class:`RuntimeAttachments` and are addressed by stable QIEC IDs.

Handlers are lexical and deep.  A resumption reinstalls the matched handler and
every inner continuation frame, whereas a handler clause is evaluated only in
the outer context.  This distinction is easiest to make explicit with the CEK
machine below: handling an operation splits the continuation at its matching
handler boundary.

        The search runs outward from the request, so the innermost

        does not cover the operation forwards to the next one out. A
        foreign clause runs here as host code and its answer is handed
        back to the machine; an authored clause is not run here at all,
        but set up as machine frames for the caller's loop to reduce.

        Parameters
        ----------
        request : EffectRequest
            The request to answer.
        environment : Mapping[Local, object]
            Values in scope at the request.
        stack : list[_Frame]
            The frame stack, searched outward for a handler.
        search_index : int
            Where in the stack to begin looking, so a forwarded request
            resumes the search outside the handler that forwarded it

        ------
        UnhandledEffectError

        ResumptionUsageError

        InvalidHandlerError
            If the handler disagrees with the request's interface, a total

        A handler with a context factory gets a fresh instance per

        not share state. One without is installed as it stands.

        Parameters
        ----------
        prototype : RuntimeHandler
            The attached handler, or the factory that makes one.

        InvalidHandlerError
            If a context factory returned a handler for a different
            checked definition, or if a handler holding mutable state was
