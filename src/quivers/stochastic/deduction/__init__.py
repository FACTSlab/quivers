"""The deduction-system surface: model type, abstract primitives,
and the three independent operations on a deduction.

This package gathers everything a user needs for working with a
weighted deduction system in one importable path. The contents
fall into three orthogonal groups:

* **Model type** (`DeductionSystem`) — the concrete agenda-based
  chart deduction that compiles from a `deduction` block in the
  QVR DSL. Re-exported from [`quivers.stochastic.agenda`][quivers.stochastic.agenda].
* **Abstract primitives** (`.primitives`) —
  `Axiom`, `Deduction`, `Goal`,
  `Schedule`, `DeductiveSystem`: the protocol layer
  the agenda implementation derives from. Most users will not
  need these directly; they exist for custom-deduction subclasses
  and for the inside-algorithm framework
  ([`quivers.stochastic.inside`][quivers.stochastic.inside]).
* **Operations** — three independent surfaces over a
  ``DeductionSystem`` with no overlap in purpose:
    * `.fit` — point-estimate gradient fitting (MAP / MLE);
    * `.bayes` — Bayesian wrapping for NUTS / SVI;
    * `.sample` — exact length-conditional forward
      sampling of yields.

These three live in separate submodules because they answer
different questions (estimate parameters at a point vs. sample a
posterior vs. generate synthetic data) and so that adding more
operations in the future does not bloat any one module.
