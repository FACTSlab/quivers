"""Agenda-based weighted-deduction engine.

A general framework for evaluating weighted deductive systems by
agenda-driven semi-naïve enumeration. Subsumes CKY, Earley,
Viterbi, A* parsing, Knuth's algorithm, semi-naïve Datalog
evaluation, and bidirectional MLTT type-checking under one
runtime, parameterized by an `Item` algebra, a list of
arity-n `InferenceRule` hyperedges, a `ChartSemiring`,
an `Agenda` data structure, a priority function, and a
goal predicate.

Categorical denotation: the chart is the least pre-fixed point of
the rule-system functor

.. math::

    F : \\mathbf{Set}^{I^{\\mathrm{op}}}_{K} \\to \\mathbf{Set}^{I^{\\mathrm{op}}}_{K}

in the :math:`K`-enriched lattice of charts (Tarski-Knaster). The
chart is the :math:`K`-presheaf :math:`I^{\\mathrm{op}} \\to K`
assigning the aggregate inside weight to each item. The agenda is
an operational realisation of the fixed-point computation; the
strategy-independence theorem (Goodman 1999 §3) guarantees that
the chart's final value is independent of the agenda discipline
when the semiring is idempotent.

    the chart's final value is independent of the ``agenda``

    Algorithm (Shieber-Schabes-Pereira 1995, Fig. 2 with
    semiring-weighted aggregation per Goodman 1999):

    1. Push every axiom onto the agenda.
    2. While the agenda is non-empty:
       a. Pop an item.
       b. Insert-or-aggregate into the chart.
       c. If the chart's weight changed, fire every rule for which
          the popped item is a premise: scan the chart for matching
          siblings, compute the conclusion's weight via the rule's
          ``weight_fn``, and push the conclusion onto the agenda.
    3. Return the chart with all items that match ``goal``.
