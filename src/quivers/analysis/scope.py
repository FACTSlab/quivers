"""Scope-path resolution for compiled QVR modules.

Every meta-command in the REPL that takes a binding name (``:info``,
``:type``, ``:doc``, ``:browse``, ``:where``, ...) routes through
the resolver in this module. The grammar of a scope path is::

    path     ::= name ('::' name)*
    name     ::= a valid Python-style identifier

The leftmost segment is looked up against the module's top-level
declarations (objects / spaces / morphisms / rules / programs /
deductions / signatures / encoders / decoders / losses / bundles /
contractions / categories / compositions). Each subsequent segment
is looked up against the previous binding's *scope view*, a
``Mapping[str, ScopedRef]`` derived from its AST shape:

* A ``program lda(α, β) : ...`` exposes its typed parameters and
  every step (``sample`` / ``observe`` / ``let`` / ``marginalize`` /
  ``score`` / ``return``) by the names they bind.
* A ``marginalize z : T <- F [over=G]`` exposes its inner body
  steps the same way, so ``lda::z::w`` works the same as
  ``lda::w`` would at top level.
* A ``deduction CCG`` exposes ``rules`` and ``atoms`` as
  sub-bindings; each rule under ``rules`` exposes ``premises`` and
  ``conclusion`` for further drill-down.
* A ``signature LF`` exposes ``sorts`` / ``constructors`` /
  ``binders`` / ``vertex_kinds`` / ``edge_kinds`` as sub-maps.
* ``encoder`` / ``decoder`` / ``bundle`` / inline-bodied
  ``composition`` declarations expose the named entries from their
  bodies (``op_rules``, member rule names, ``tensor_op`` / ``join``
  / ``unit`` / ``zero``).

Container kinds that do not introduce names (``rule`` premise
patterns, ``let`` value expressions, leaf morphisms) return an
empty scope; the resolver stops walking at them.

The resolver is purely structural. It does *not* recompile the
program; it reads the already-elaborated AST nodes from the
``Compiler`` instance the REPL hands it. Consumers that need
runtime values (a sample site's actual tensor, a deduction rule's
weight) should look those up via the runtime accessors after
locating the binding.
