"""Continuous morphisms: Markov kernels on continuous and mixed spaces.

A ContinuousMorphism represents a conditional probability distribution
p(y | x) where x and y may live in either discrete (FinSet) or
continuous (ContinuousSpace) spaces. The morphism is defined by two
operations:

    log_prob(x, y) — log-density/probability of y given x
    rsample(x)     — reparameterized samples from p(· | x)

Composition samples ancestrally. Its density marginalizes a discrete
intermediate exactly, by finite summation:

    (g . f)(x, z) = sum_y f(x, y) g(y, z)

A continuous intermediate is not marginalized. The chain is scored
along its canonical path instead: every stochastic factor's
intermediate is bound to the image of its base measure's origin, each
factor is scored once along that path, and the supplied value scores
the last of them. That is exact where the integral would have been
approximate, and it is a pure function of the endpoints where a
quadrature would have made it a function of the node count as well.
No branch draws samples, so a composite density is the same number on
every call and under every global RNG state.

This module provides:

    ContinuousMorphism         — abstract base with >> and @ operators
    SampledComposition         — f >> g via ancestral sampling
    ProductContinuousMorphism  — f @ g (independent product)
    DiscreteAsContinuous       — wrap a discrete Morphism as continuous

Convention for input shapes

- Discrete domain (SetObject): x is LongTensor of shape (batch,)
- Continuous domain (ContinuousSpace): x is FloatTensor of shape (batch, dim)
- Discrete codomain: y is LongTensor of shape (batch,)

    When Y is continuous and ``left`` is stochastic the integral has
    no closed form, and

    scores the chain's canonical path rather than approximating it:
    the intermediate is bound to the image of ``left``'s base-measure

    endpoint, and it is exact, rule-free and reproducible where the

        The chain's marginal at ``z`` integrates each continuous
        intermediate, and no closed form covers that integral once a
        factor is a genuinely stochastic kernel. A deterministic
        quadrature approximates it, and the approximation is a
        property of the rule rather than of the model: the value moves
        by thousands of nats when the node count changes, because one
        point set of a fixed size has to resolve a Gaussian whose
        scale a later factor predicts, in as many dimensions as the
        whole prefix places coordinates. A density no two rules agree
        on is not a density anything can be compared against.

        What this evaluates instead is exact, and needs no rule. The
        chain's intermediates are bound to the images of the base
        measure's origin, one per stochastic factor, which is what
        [`push_base`][quivers.continuous.morphisms.ContinuousMorphism.push_base]
        at zero coordinates returns; every factor is then scored once
        along that path, and the supplied ``z`` scores the last of
        them:

        .. math::

            \\sum_{k<n} \\log p_k(y_k \\mid y_{k-1})
            + \\log p_n(z \\mid y_{n-1}),
            \\qquad y_k = T_{y_{k-1}}(0).

        The origin is a fixed point of the reparameterization, not a
        draw, so the whole value is a pure function of ``(x, z)`` and
        the factors' parameters: bitwise identical under every global
        RNG state and under every node count, because there is no node
        count left. A degenerate factor contributes no density and
        passes its point mass along, exactly as the marginal treats
        it, so a chain whose intermediates are all deterministic
        scores the same number either way.

        This is the density of the *path*, not the marginal of its
        endpoint. The two differ by the intermediates the integral
        would have removed, and the path is the object worth scoring:
        a joint that drops the prefix carries none of the structure
        the chain's own factors declare.

        Parameters
        ----------
        x : torch.Tensor
            Inputs to the chain. Shape ``(batch, *domain)``.
        z : torch.Tensor
