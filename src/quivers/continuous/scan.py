"""Scan combinator: temporal recurrence over sequences.

A ScanMorphism wraps a recurrent cell and applies it across a
sequence, threading hidden state from one time step to the next.
This implements the standard RNN pattern:

    h_t = cell(x_t, h_{t-1})

where cell : A * H -> H is a morphism (either a plain
ContinuousMorphism or a MonadicProgram) whose domain is a
product of the per-timestep input space A and the hidden state
space H, and whose codomain is H.

Given a cell : A * H -> H, ``scan(cell)`` produces a morphism
A -> H that, at runtime:

1. Expects a 3D input tensor of shape (batch, seq_len, dim_A).
2. Initializes hidden state h_0 (zeros or a learned parameter).
3. At each step t, concatenates x[:, t, :] with h to form the
   cell input, then calls cell.rsample to produce the new h.
4. Returns the final hidden state h_T of shape (batch, dim_H).

The scan's type in the categorical framework is:

    scan(f : A x H -> H) : A -> H

where the sequence structure is implicit in the tensor's time
dimension, following standard neural network conventions.

Initialization strategies
-------------------------
- ``"zeros"``: h_0 = 0 (default).
- ``"learned"``: h_0 is a learnable nn.Parameter.

Examples
--------
>>> from quivers.continuous.spaces import Euclidean, ProductSpace
>>> from quivers.continuous.families import ConditionalNormal
>>> A = Euclidean(name="input", dim=32)
>>> H = Euclidean(name="hidden", dim=64)
>>> cell = ConditionalNormal(ProductSpace(A, H), H, scale=0.1)
>>> scanned = ScanMorphism(cell, init="zeros")
>>> scanned.domain   # Euclidean(name="input", dim=32)
>>> scanned.codomain # Euclidean(name="hidden", dim=64)
>>> x = torch.randn(8, 10, 32)  # batch=8, seq_len=10, input_dim=32
>>> h = scanned.rsample(x)      # (8, 64)

        No closed form covers that integral for a cell that draws fresh
        per-step noise, and integrating it numerically is not a second
        route to it, for three reasons that are properties of the
        integrand rather than of any particular rule. First, the
        integrand is a Gaussian whose scale the cell itself predicts,
        so its mass concentrates on a set a feasible node budget does
        not resolve and the value tracks the budget instead of
        converging within it. Second, the recurrence amplifies: a
        perturbation of the state grows by roughly an order of
        magnitude per step, so the log-sum-exp is carried by one node
        whose identity turns on differences far below the working
        precision, and an independent implementation of the identical
        map reports a different number. Third, a nested rule costs one
        point set per factor at every evaluation, which puts gradient
        based inference on a sequence model out of reach.

        What this returns instead is the *trajectory's* joint density,
        which is exact and needs no rule at all: the states
        [`reference_trajectory`][quivers.continuous.scan.ScanMorphism.reference_trajectory]
        names are bound as if they were sites of their own, and
        [`log_joint`][quivers.continuous.scan.ScanMorphism.log_joint]
        scores every transition along them,

        .. math::

            \\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\log p(h_t \\mid x_t, h_{t-1}),
            \\qquad h_T = y .

        Every factor the source declares is scored once, the observed
        state enters through the last of them, and the value is a pure
        function of ``(x, y)`` and the cell's parameters, so it is
        bitwise reproducible across global RNG states.

        Reproducible, but not well conditioned. The prefix is a
        recurrence, so it amplifies: a cell whose predicted scale is
        small compared to the distance between the prefix's last state
        and ``y`` puts the last term's sensitivity at
        :math:`(y - \\mu) / \\sigma^2` per coordinate, and a
        perturbation of the prefix at the level of floating-point
        re-association arrives there multiplied by seven steps of the
        cell's Jacobian. A reconstruction that spells the cell's affine
        maps differently (``x @ W.T + b`` rather than the
        ``torch.nn.functional.linear`` the parameter source calls)
        therefore does not agree to round-off. What the value needs to
        be compared against is the same map, not merely the same
        formula.

        It is a density of the trajectory, not the marginal of its
        endpoint, and the two differ by the prefix the integral above
        would have removed. What makes the trajectory the right object
        to score is that the prefix is where a recurrent model keeps
        its structure: a joint that omits it carries none of the
        transition density the source declares, which is the whole of
        the model apart from its emission.

        A cell that denotes a program rather than a family has no
        conditional density at all
        ([`has_conditional_density`][quivers.continuous.morphisms.ContinuousMorphism.has_conditional_density]
        says so), and its transitions cannot be scored this way: the
        density of one step at a state marginalizes that step's own
        internal draws, so the step is exactly the problem the whole
        recurrence poses, one position smaller. Such a scan keeps the
        deterministic-recurrence reading, under which the trajectory is
        a function of the cell's weight latents, those latents are
        scored on their own ``sample`` steps, and the state itself
        carries a Dirac's zero. That zero is a modelling convention and
        understates a stochastic cell's joint by its whole recurrent
        structure; the route out is to expose the cell's per-step draws
        as sites, not to integrate them.

            All hidden states including final, shape
            ``(batch, seq_len, hidden_dim)``. May be passed
            positionally as a tensor or via a dict keyed by
            ``state_key`` (so the inference layer's standard
