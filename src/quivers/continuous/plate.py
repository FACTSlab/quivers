"""Hierarchical Bayesian modelling primitives.

Adds the operations needed to express models of the kind found in
hierarchical Bayesian regression / latent-class analysis (the
canonical Stan workhorse): finite-domain-indexed draws (plates),
vectorized observations with gather indexing, LKJ priors on
correlation matrices, ordinal monotone splines via cumulative
sum, and generic distribution truncation. Each primitive is
declared with its categorical denotation in :math:`\\mathbf{Kern}`;
the runtime is a straight realisation of those denotations.

Categorical foundations
-----------------------
* **Plate (indexed draw)**. Given a finite index set :math:`A` and a
  parameterized family :math:`F : \\Theta \\to \\mathcal{G}(B)`, a
  *plate draw* declares the kernel

  .. math::

      v : A \\to B,\\quad v(a) \\sim F(\\theta(a))

  equivalently a single morphism into the function space
  :math:`\\mathbf{1} \\to \\mathcal{G}(B^A)` factoring as the
  independent product :math:`\\prod_{a \\in A} F(\\theta(a))`. Under
  the natural isomorphism
  :math:`\\mathbf{Kern}(\\mathbf{1}, B^A) \\cong \\mathbf{Kern}(A, B)`
  the plate variable IS a :math:`\\mathbf{Kern}`-morphism
  :math:`A \\to B`; in the variational backend it is held as a
  tensor of shape ``(|A|, *B.shape)`` whose prior contribution to
  the ELBO is the per-row log-density.

* **Gather**. Given a finite fibration :math:`\\iota : N \\to A` (a
  per-observation grouping assignment) and a plate variable
  :math:`v : A \\to B`, the gathered morphism is the pullback
  :math:`\\iota^* v = v \\circ \\iota : N \\to B`. Categorically a
  textbook reindexing morphism in :math:`\\mathbf{Kern}`; runtime is
  ``v[indices]`` along the leading axis.

* **Vectorised observe**. A batched observation step

  .. math::

      \\mathcal{S}\\llbracket\\,\\mathsf{observe}\\ r[n] \\sim
      F(\\theta[n])\\ \\mathsf{for}\\ n\\in N\\,\\rrbracket :
      \\Phi \\to \\mathcal{G}_{\\le 1}(\\Phi)

  has score :math:`\\prod_{n \\in N} p_F(r_{\\text{obs}}(n);\\,
  \\theta(n,\\phi))`. The single-observation form is the
  ``|N| = 1`` special case; mass-correctness follows from the
  Cho-Jacobs Markov-with-conditioning calculus.

* **Marginalise (program-level)**. Given a previously-drawn
  discrete latent :math:`c : \\Phi \\to \\mathcal{G}(C)`, the
  marginalisation step is the pushforward through the projection
  :math:`\\pi_{\\Phi \\setminus C} : \\Phi \\times C \\to \\Phi`:

  .. math::

      \\mathsf{marg}(c) = \\mathcal{G}(\\pi_{\\Phi \\setminus C})
                         \\circ \\mathcal{S}\\llbracket\\mathsf{draw}\\ c\\rrbracket

  numerically realised as :math:`\\log \\sum_c \\exp(\\cdot)` over
  the :math:`C` axis of the per-class log-likelihoods.

* **cumsum**. The deterministic morphism
  :math:`\\mathrm{cumsum} : \\mathrm{Euclidean}(K) \\to \\mathrm{Euclidean}(K)`,
  :math:`(x_1, \\dots, x_K) \\mapsto (x_1, x_1 + x_2, \\dots,
  \\sum_i x_i)`. Used for the standard monotonic-spline
  parameterization of ordinal coefficients.

* **LKJ correlation prior**. The Lewandowski-Kurowicka-Joe
  distribution :math:`\\mathrm{LKJ}(K, \\eta)` on the manifold
  :math:`\\mathrm{Corr}_K` of :math:`K \\times K` correlation
  matrices, parameterized via the Cholesky factor for numerical
  stability. The accompanying ``cholesky_quad_form`` deterministic
  morphism reconstructs a full covariance
  :math:`\\Sigma = \\mathrm{diag}(s)\\, R\\, \\mathrm{diag}(s)`
  from a correlation :math:`R` and a per-component scale
  :math:`s \\in \\mathrm{PositiveReals}(K)`.

* **Truncated**. Given a base family :math:`F` and an interval
  :math:`[a, b]`, the truncated family
  :math:`F_{|[a, b]}` has density
  :math:`p_F(x) / (F_{\\text{cdf}}(b) - F_{\\text{cdf}}(a))` on
  :math:`[a, b]` and zero elsewhere. Realised via inverse-CDF
  sampling when available; rejection otherwise.

    Parameters
    ----------
    log_likelihood_per_row_per_class : torch.Tensor or list/tuple of torch.Tensor
        Single tensor: a per-(response, class) log-likelihood of
        shape ``(N, K)``, used in the single-axis form. List or
        tuple of tensors: per-axis log-likelihoods of shapes
        ``(N_m, K)``, used in the multi-axis form. The class axis
        ``K`` must agree across all entries.
    group_index : torch.Tensor, tuple of torch.Tensor, or list of either
        Single-axis form: a long tensor of shape ``(N,)`` (single
        fibration) or a tuple of co-indexed long tensors (product
        fibration). Multi-axis form: a list of length ``M``,
        parallel to the log-likelihood list; each entry is itself
        either a single tensor or a product-fibration tuple, exactly
        as in the single-axis form.
    log_prior_per_group_per_class : torch.Tensor
        Per-(group, class) log-prior of shape ``(num_groups, K)``,
        ``(K,)`` (broadcast over the group axis), or, for product
        fibrations, ``(num_groups_1, ..., num_groups_r, K)``.
    num_groups : int or tuple[int, ...]
        Cardinality of the (product) group plate.
    reduction : {"logsumexp", "sum", "mean"}
        Per-group reduction over the class axis. ``logsumexp`` is
        the canonical mixture marginalisation; ``sum`` joint-scores
        without marginalising the class; ``mean`` averages
        symmetrically. Default ``logsumexp``.

    Returns
    -------
    torch.Tensor
        Scalar program-level log-density contribution.

    Notes
    -----
    Edge cases:

    * ``K == 1``: the log-sum-exp collapses to the body's
      log-likelihood plus the constant log-prior.
    * Identity fibration (``group_index = arange(N)`` and
      ``num_groups == N``): each row is its own group, recovering
      the per-row mixture.
    * Empty fibre: contributes a multiplicative identity to the
      product (``log 1 = 0``), so an unused group adds zero per
      class before the reduction.
    * Multi-axis with a single entry (``M = 1``): exactly
      equivalent to the single-axis form, modulo unboxing the
      singleton list.
