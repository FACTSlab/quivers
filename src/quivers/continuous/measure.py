"""Sub-Giry measure algebra: the compositional vocabulary for
distributions.

A `Measure` is an unnormalised positive measure on a Borel space.
Probability distributions are the special case where the total
mass is one; sub-probability measures arise naturally from
restriction and from likelihood scoring. The runtime tracks the
log of the total mass (the "log-normaliser") symbolically and
only renormalises at the observe / sample boundary.

The seven primitive constructions are:

* [`PointMass(x)`][quivers.continuous.measure.PointMass] —
  Dirac measure at `x`, the unit $\\eta$ of the Giry monad.
* [`Restrict(D, low, high)`][quivers.continuous.measure.Restrict] —
  restriction of `D` to a measurable subset, the sub-Giry monad's
  natural operation. Does not renormalise.
* [`Pushforward(D, b)`][quivers.continuous.measure.Pushforward] —
  pushforward through a `Bijector`, the functoriality of the
  Giry monad on measurable isomorphisms.
* [`Mixture(weights, components)`][quivers.continuous.measure.Mixture] —
  n-ary convex combination, the unique algebra structure on the
  Giry monad's Eilenberg-Moore category.
* [`Independent(D, n)`][quivers.continuous.measure.Independent] —
  declare the last `n` batch dims as event dims (the strong
  monoidal product of independent copies).
* [`Normalize(D)`][quivers.continuous.measure.Normalize] —
  rescale a sub-measure to a probability measure, lifting from
  the sub-Giry to the Giry monad. Only defined where the total
  mass is strictly positive.

Categorical sources:

* [Giry 1982](https://doi.org/10.1007/BFb0092872) — the probability monad.
