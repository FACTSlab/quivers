"""Bridges between the monad and arrow typeclass towers.

Three canonical conversions:

- :func:`kleisli` — given a :class:`Monad` instance ``m``, produce a
  ``Kleisli(m)`` arrow whose hom from ``A`` to ``B`` is the V-Rel
  morphism set ``Hom(A, m(B))``.
- :func:`arrow_monad` — given an :class:`ArrowApply` instance ``a``,
  produce a :class:`Monad` whose underlying functor is
  ``ArrowMonad(a)(α) = a(1, α)``.
- :func:`cokleisli` — comonadic dual of :func:`kleisli`.

Each bridge is realised at the value level as concrete morphism
constructions: ``compose`` is Kleisli composition (fmap-then-join),
``first`` is the monad's strength applied to the second-factor
input, ``app`` is the canonical evaluator over the function-space
encoding ``[A → B]``. The bridge round-trip ``arrow_monad ∘ kleisli``
is the identity on monad theories (Hughes 2000, Theorem 3.1).
