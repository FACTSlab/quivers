# QIEC distribution bridge for generated Turing modules. A QIEC tensor is
# a nested tuple until it reaches a distribution, where it becomes an
# array with the tuple's outermost axis first; a log density is
# Distributions.jl's `logpdf` at the converted value. A family whose
# Distributions.jl support is shifted against the QIEC convention is
# wrapped with its offset, which is added to the scored value.
