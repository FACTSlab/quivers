"""Runtime helpers grafted into emitted PyMC programs.

PyMC ships no continuous-Bernoulli distribution, so the renderer
grafts the [`ContinuousBernoulli`][quivers.transpile.runtime_pymc.ContinuousBernoulli]
wrapper below into the emitted module. The wrapper builds a
[`pymc.CustomDist`][pymc.CustomDist] whose log-density is the exact
continuous-Bernoulli density (including its parameter-dependent
normalising constant), so the emitted program's joint log-density
matches the QVR model's `torch.distributions.ContinuousBernoulli`
term.

PyMC also ships no distribution over correlation Cholesky factors
alone: [`pymc.LKJCholeskyCov`][pymc.LKJCholeskyCov] multiplies in a
standard-deviation prior the QVR model does not have, and
[`pymc.LKJCorr`][pymc.LKJCorr] carries the LKJ density of the
correlation matrix rather than of its Cholesky factor, so it omits the
factorisation Jacobian. The
[`LKJCholesky`][quivers.transpile.runtime_pymc.LKJCholesky] wrapper
below therefore supplies both halves directly: the exact
`torch.distributions.LKJCholesky` log-density, evaluated on the
Cholesky factor and normalised, and a matching forward sampler. The
sampler is the C-vine method of Lewandowski, Kurowicka, and Joe, which
draws the canonical partial correlations from Beta laws and maps them
through the partial-correlation recursion straight to the Cholesky
factor, so its off-diagonal correlation marginals follow the LKJ law
and stay exchangeable across off-diagonals. PyMC's own onion sampler
for `pymc.LKJCorr` is not reused: it produces off-diagonal marginals
that do not match the LKJ law.

The renderer parses this file through panproto's Python tree-sitter
grammar at module-load time and copies each top-level
`function_definition` subtree into the per-render schema, so the
emitted source carries a real function definition rather than a
string of source or an `exec`.
