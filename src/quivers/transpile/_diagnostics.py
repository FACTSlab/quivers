"""Turn a refusal's structured `kinds` list into prose the person who
wrote the QVR program can act on.

Every refusal in `quivers.transpile` raises
[`UnsupportedConstruct`][quivers.transpile.UnsupportedConstruct] with a
list of *kinds*. A kind is a machine-matchable identifier that consumers
(the construct-matrix test, the CLI, downstream tooling) dispatch on. It
is not a message. This module is the one place that turns kinds into
messages.

The kind grammar
----------------

    kind        ::= head ( ":" segment )* [ ": " explanation ]
    head        ::= a registered dispatch key, no spaces
    segment     ::= a name / number / token the refusal is about, no spaces
    explanation ::= free prose, written at the raise site

The head selects a renderer below. The segments carry the construct's
own name, so the message can say `cell` rather than `IRArgFamilyRef`.
The optional explanation starts at the first colon-*space* in the kind:
segments never contain a space, so the split is unambiguous. A raise
site writes an explanation when it knows something about the target
language the shared renderer cannot know (BUGS having no free
log-density statement, Stan having no method dispatch); the renderer
then contributes only the headline and lets the explanation carry the
reason.

Four things a refusal has to say, and where each comes from:

1. **What** was refused, named as the user wrote it. The segments.
2. **Where**, when the construct carries a line. The segments, or the
   [`RefusedDeclaration`][quivers.transpile._diagnostics.RefusedDeclaration]
   records `unsupported_for` collects off the AST.
3. **Why this target cannot take it**, in the target language's own
   terms. The renderer plus the raise-site explanation.
4. **What to do instead**, or a plain statement that the construct has
   no form in that language.
