"""JAGS renderer: [`IRProgram`][quivers.transpile.ir.IRProgram] to JAGS
source under the ``jags`` tree-sitter grammar.

The JAGS surface mirrors BUGS for the probabilistic-core subset QVR
targets: a single top-level ``model { ... }`` block whose children are
``~`` stochastic relations and ``<-`` deterministic relations, nested
under ``for (m_<axis> in 1:N_<axis>) { ... }`` loops to express plate
structure. JAGS-specific family names (``ddirich`` for Dirichlet,
``dgen.gamma`` for generalised Gamma, etc.) and arithmetic-converting
parameterisation renames (Normal ``scale`` -> ``tau = 1/(scale*scale)``
via the [`IRArgTransform`][quivers.transpile.renderers._base.IRArgTransform]
mechanism) come from
[`FAMILY_META`][quivers.transpile.family_meta.FAMILY_META].

The renderer:

* Treats every IR declaration as a no-op (JAGS variables are declared
  implicitly by their first ``~`` / ``<-`` binding; data inputs ride
  on an external ``.data`` file the host supplies).
* Lowers [`IRSample`][quivers.transpile.ir.IRSample] and
  [`IRObserve`][quivers.transpile.ir.IRObserve] to per-batch-axis
  ``for (m_<axis> in 1:N_<axis>) { <name>[m_<axis>] ~ d<family>(args) }``
  nests.
* Lowers [`IRMarginalize`][quivers.transpile.ir.IRMarginalize] to the
  weighted sum over the latent's finite support
  ([`RendererBase.marginal_atoms`][quivers.transpile.renderers._base.RendererBase.marginal_atoms]),
  declaring no latent site and adding the sum's logarithm to the joint
  through the zeros trick.
* Refuses to emit a scalar broadcast to a vector / matrix arg or a
  bare list / matrix literal, raising
  [`UnsupportedConstruct`][quivers.transpile._api.UnsupportedConstruct]
  with a typed kind tag (callers pre-bind vector data via a let-decl
  before transpiling).
* Appends ``T(L, U)`` truncation idiom when an
  [`IRArgFamilyRef`][quivers.transpile.ir.IRArgFamilyRef] resolves to
  a ``Truncated(...)`` wrapper.

        ``Omega = [[2, .5], [.5, 1.5]]``, ``mu = (.1, .3)`` and

        therefore scores a different Gaussian at every point.

        A site that already names ``precision_matrix`` passes through

        """Emit a `BetaBinomial` observation through the zeros trick.

        A stock JAGS engine loads `basemod`, `bugs`, and `dic`, and
        none of the three registers a beta-binomial: JAGS carries one
        only in the optional `mix` module, so naming a distribution
        here would compile on some installations and fail with
        ``Unknown distribution`` on others. The density itself needs
        nothing optional. `loggam` and `logfact` both live in the
        `bugs` module, so
        [`beta_binomial_log_pmf`][quivers.transpile.renderers._bugs_helpers.beta_binomial_log_pmf]
        writes the marginal out in closed form and the zeros trick adds
        it to the joint: with `zeros_<name>[n]` bound to 0 in the
        `data { ... }` block, `zeros_<name>[n] ~ dpois(phi_<name>[n])`
        contributes `-phi_<name>[n]`, so

            phi_<name>[n] <- -log p(y_n)

        adds exactly `log p(y_n)` per row, with no additive constant
        at all.

        The zeros trick usually carries a large positive offset `C`,
        emitted as `phi <- C - <term>`, because the Poisson rate has to
        stay in support and a general score term is unbounded above.
        [`_emit_score`][quivers.transpile.renderers.jags.JAGSRenderer._emit_score]
        and
        [`_emit_mixture_normal`][quivers.transpile.renderers.jags.JAGSRenderer._emit_mixture_normal]
        both need it: a user score expression is arbitrary, and a
        Gaussian mixture's log-*density* exceeds zero wherever the
        mixture concentrates. A beta-binomial is a *mass* function, so
        `p(y_n) <= 1` and `-log p(y_n) >= 0` at every parameter value
        in the support, with equality only for a point mass. The rate
        is therefore in support without an offset, and dropping it
        makes the emitted program denote the reference measure on the
        nose rather than up to a constant Theorem 4.1's quotient has to
        absorb: the cell's named constant is the folded-family
        derivation's value and nothing else. (The residual pointwise
        spread is unchanged at roughly `6e-6`, so the `1e6`-scale
        cancellation was not what bounded the agreement; the offset had
        to go because it was an unentitled constant, not because it was
        imprecise.)

        The emitted relation reads `phi_<name>[n] <- -(<term>)`, whose
        text runs the two operators together as `<--`. Both the JAGS
        lexer and the tree-sitter grammar take the longest match, so
        that is the assignment arrow followed by a unary minus.

        The emitted term is the beta-binomial's own marginal, with the
        latent rate integrated out analytically, rather than the
        `p ~ dbeta(a, b); y ~ dbin(p, n)` compound: the compound adds a
        latent node per row and so scores a different joint over a
        larger space.

        A residual event axis on the site would ask each row to carry a
        vector of counts, which the scalar closed form cannot express,
        so it raises rather than emitting a differently-shaped density.
