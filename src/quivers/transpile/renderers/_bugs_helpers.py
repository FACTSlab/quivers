"""Render [`LetExprNode`][quivers.dsl.ast_nodes.LetExprNode] subtrees
to BUGS / JAGS tree-sitter schema vertices.

BUGS / JAGS share an identical expression grammar for the
deterministic-assignment idiom ``<name> <- <expr>``: ``binary_expression``,
``unary_expression``, ``function_call`` (with ``name`` and
``argument_list``), ``identifier``, ``number``, ``indexed_variable``
(with ``index_list`` carrying integer / identifier / range children),
and ``parenthesized_expression``. Neither language has a native
string literal, lambda, method-call, or list-literal at the model-body
level; those LetExpr kinds either get a structural unrolling
(``list -> c(...)`` combine, ``factor -> c(<body[0]>, <body[1]>, ...)``
unroll) or raise [`UnsupportedConstruct`][quivers.transpile._api.UnsupportedConstruct].

The helper consumes a lightweight context exposing four bound methods:

* ``ctx.fresh(prefix: str) -> str``
* ``ctx.v(vid: str, kind: str) -> str``
* ``ctx.e(src: str, tgt: str, kind: str) -> None``
* ``ctx.lit(vid: str, text: str) -> None``
* ``ctx.constraint(vid: str, sort: str, value: str) -> None``

The renderer (BUGS or JAGS) is responsible for the surrounding
``deterministic_relation`` / ``stochastic_relation`` and for binding
the helper context. When unrolling factor binders, the helper also
reads ``ctx.cards`` (a ``dict[str, int]``) and ``ctx.target`` (one of
``"bugs"`` / ``"jags"``) to resolve axis sizes and to label the error
tag with the correct backend.

    No BUGS distribution catalogue and no JAGS module carries the
    continuous Bernoulli, and no reparameterisation reaches it: it is
    the exponentially-tilted uniform on ``(0, 1)``, whose normaliser
    is a transcendental function of the tilt rather than a constant a
    named family absorbs. The density is nonetheless elementary. With
    tilt ``lambda`` (``probs``) the pdf on ``(0, 1)`` is

        p(x; lambda) = C(lambda) * lambda^x * (1 - lambda)^(1 - x),

    with normaliser

        C(lambda) = 2 * artanh(1 - 2 lambda) / (1 - 2 lambda).

    Substituting ``d = 1 - 2 lambda`` into
    ``artanh(d) = log((1 + d) / (1 - d)) / 2`` turns ``(1 + d)`` into
    ``2 (1 - lambda)`` and ``(1 - d)`` into ``2 lambda``, so the
    factors of two cancel and

        C(lambda) = (log(1 - lambda) - log(lambda)) / d.

    Numerator and denominator change sign together at
    ``lambda = 1/2``, so the ratio is positive throughout and equals
    the ratio of the two absolute values, which is what lets the log
    split into the difference of two logarithms of ``abs(...)``. The
    term this returns is therefore

        x * log(lambda) + (1 - x) * log(1 - lambda)
        + log(abs(log(1 - m) - log(m))) - log(abs(d_safe)),

    where ``d_safe`` is ``d`` displaced off the singular point and
    ``m = (1 - d_safe) / 2`` is the tilt that displacement names (see
    [`_CONT_BERNOULLI_STABLE_HALF_WIDTH`][quivers.transpile.renderers._bugs_helpers._CONT_BERNOULLI_STABLE_HALF_WIDTH]).
    The displacement is zero, and the two logarithms read the site's
    own tilt, at every ``lambda`` outside a window of half-width
    ``1e-6`` around one half. The tilted factors ``x * log(lambda)``
    and ``(1 - x) * log(1 - lambda)`` read the tilt itself
    everywhere: they carry no singularity to step around.

    Every symbol in the result (``log``, ``abs``, ``step``) is a

    reduction over a latent's atoms has no closed emission: the zeros
    trick that would write one needs a data-bound carrier the BUGS

    shape does close, and this is the recogniser for it: summing a
    categorical row matrix against mixing weights gives a categorical
    on the same alphabet, which `dcat` scores natively and exactly.

    draw (no event axis of its own) the emitted `dcat` can score.

    `None` is the honest answer for every other marginalize rather

    marginalize emissions, and the caller decides what the rest take.
