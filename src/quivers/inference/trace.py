"""Execution trace for monadic programs.

A `Trace` records every sample site visited during program
execution, capturing the morphism, sampled or observed value, and
log-density at each site. This is the foundation for all inference
algorithms: SVI uses traces to compute the ELBO, and conditioning
operates by clamping trace sites to observed data.

The `trace(program, x, observations)` free function is a thin
wrapper on top of the effect-handler machinery: it pushes a
`quivers.effects.trace_handler.TraceHandler` onto the active
handler stack, invokes `quivers.effects.interpreter.run_program`,
and returns the accumulated `Trace`. Any other handlers active in
the enclosing scope compose with `TraceHandler` in the standard
outer-to-inner order.

The `SampleSite` and `Trace` data types are defined in
`quivers.effects.trace_types` and re-exported here.

    A thin wrapper around the handler-aware interpreter: pushes a
    `quivers.effects.trace_handler.TraceHandler` onto the active
    handler stack, delegates to

    Parameters
    ----------
    program : MonadicProgram
        The program to trace.
    x : torch.Tensor
        Program input. Shape ``(batch, ...)``.
    observations : dict[str, torch.Tensor] or None
        Values to clamp observed variables to. Keys are variable
        names, values are tensors of the appropriate shape.

    Returns
    -------
    Trace
        Complete execution trace with all sites, output, and
        log-joint.
