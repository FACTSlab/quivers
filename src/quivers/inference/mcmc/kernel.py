"""MCMC kernel abstract base + shared state container.

Every MCMC kernel under [`quivers.inference.mcmc`][quivers.inference.mcmc] follows the
same contract: an `init` method that produces a starting
`KernelState` from a `LatentRegistry` and an
optional initial flat unconstrained position, and a `step`
method that consumes the current state plus the model + data and
returns the next state.

All kernels operate on the *flat unconstrained* latent vector
provided by the registry. The model's log-joint is evaluated by
unflattening, pushing through per-site bijectors (with the
Jacobian correction), and calling `MonadicProgram.log_joint`
on the constrained sites. The Jacobian-corrected scalar is the
*unconstrained-space* log-density that the kernel walks; this is
the standard NumPyro / Pyro pattern, and it is what makes
constrained-support sites (HalfNormal, Dirichlet, Beta, …)
samplable by gradient-based MCMC without any special-casing in
the kernel itself.

    Attributes
    ----------
    position : torch.Tensor
        Current flat unconstrained latent vector. Shape ``(D,)``
        for one chain, ``(num_chains, D)`` for parallel chains.
    log_density : torch.Tensor
        Unconstrained-space log-density (Jacobian-corrected
        log-joint) at ``position``. Shape ``()`` or
        ``(num_chains,)``.
    grad_log_density : torch.Tensor
        Gradient of ``log_density`` with respect to ``position``,
        same shape as ``position``. Cached so leapfrog re-uses the
        last-evaluated gradient at the proposal endpoint.
    step_count : int
        Number of `step` calls so far (counts both warmup
        and post-warmup steps).
    accept_count : int
        Number of proposals accepted across the chain. Useful for
        reporting acceptance rate.
    diverged : bool
        Whether the most recent step's energy error exceeded the
        kernel's divergence threshold. Reset by each kernel
        as appropriate.
    extras : dict
        Per-kernel additional state (e.g. NUTS tree depth, HMC
        step-size adaptation cumulants).
