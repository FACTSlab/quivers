"""MCMC kernels, adaptation primitives, and the chain driver.

Public surface (the kernels and driver are also re-exported from
`quivers.inference`):

* `MCMCKernel`: ABC for Markov kernels on the flat unconstrained
  latent vector, with `KernelState` as its per-chain state and
  `PotentialFn` as the potential it evaluates.
* `HMCKernel`: Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with leapfrog integration,
  dual-averaging step-size adaptation, and Welford mass-matrix
  adaptation, parameterized by a `MassMatrixKind`.
* `NUTSKernel`: No-U-Turn Sampler with multinomial sampling.
* `DualAveraging`, `WelfordCovariance`, and
  `find_reasonable_step_size`: the warmup adaptation primitives the
  kernels share.
* `MCMC`: chain orchestrator with warmup, parallel chains, an
  `InitStrategy`, and posterior diagnostics (split-:math:`\\hat R`,
  effective sample size).
* `MCMCResult`: posterior samples and per-chain diagnostics.
