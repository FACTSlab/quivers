"""Brms-style formula frontend over the QVR DSL.

A user writes a regression formula (Wilkinson notation, extended with
brms-style random-effect groups) and gets a fitted Bayesian model
without hand-writing ``.qvr`` source.  The compiler emits programs
that route through the existing QVR DSL surface:

* fixed-effect linear predictors as morphism composition
  ``X >> beta`` over ``observed`` design-matrix morphisms,
* random-effect groups as plate-gather of per-level latent draws,
* responses as ``observe`` sites with the family-link kernel
  (Gaussian / Bernoulli / Binomial / Categorical / Poisson /
  NegativeBinomial / Cumulative / Beta / Gamma / Student-t /
  ZeroInflatedPoisson / HurdlePoisson / Mixture)
  registered in [`quivers.formulas.family`][quivers.formulas.family].

The implementation reuses [`formulae`](https://bambinos.github.io/formulae/)
for formula parsing (the Bambi team's pure-Python parser; supports
brms-style ``(slope | group)`` random effects, smooth terms, and
custom contrasts) and lifts the resulting `DesignMatrices`
into a typed `Formula` `didactic.api.Model`.

The frontend is the formula→QVR direction of a panproto lens; the
QVR DSL is the canonical source of truth, and the formula compiler
is a structure-preserving translation from the smaller formula
language to the QVR DSL.  Future versions will register the
formula schema as a panproto protocol so the get/put bidirectional
machinery applies.
