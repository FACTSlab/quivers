"""Docker container driver for out-of-process probes.

Each Tier-3 probe runs in its own pinned image, invoked once per
``(fixture, point_set)``. The driver here centralises the bind-mount
+ argv shape so per-backend probes only need to specify the image
tag and their entrypoint script.

The host's `docker` CLI is the dependency. When `docker` is not on
PATH or the host daemon is not running, [`docker_available`][.]
returns False and the calling test should `pytest.skip`.

Each image carries a corresponding script under
[`tests/transpile/probes/_scripts/<backend>.py`][tests.transpile.probes._scripts]
that reads `/io/source.<ext>`, `/io/points.json`, and emits
`/io/result.json` (a JSON object with one ``log_densities`` key).
