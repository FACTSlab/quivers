"""Tier 5: distribution-family × backend support matrix.

For every family in
[`_get_family_registry`][quivers.dsl.compiler._prelude._get_family_registry]
and every registered backend:

- If `FAMILY_META[family].target_names` contains `backend`, the
  transpile must succeed and the emitted source must reference the
  backend-specific distribution name (e.g. Stan `beta`, NumPyro
  `Beta`, BUGS `dbeta`).
- If the family/backend pair is absent from `target_names`, the
  transpile must raise
  `UnsupportedConstruct(kinds=["family:<Family>"])`.

The matrix is the source of truth for the docs page "which backends
support which families."
