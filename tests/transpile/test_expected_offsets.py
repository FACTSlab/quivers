"""Named-constant equivalence: the offset a backend is *entitled* to.

Theorem 4.1 of
[docs/semantics/transpile-correctness](../../docs/semantics/transpile-correctness/index.md)
declares a transpiled program correct when its log-density agrees with
the QVR reference measure up to an additive constant that does not
depend on the evaluation point. The gallery suite enforces exactly that
statement through
[`assert_log_density_match`][tests.transpile._equivalence.assert_log_density_match]:
it subtracts the mean of the pointwise differences and bounds the
residual spread.

That statement has a soft spot, which this module closes. Quantifying
existentially over the constant ("there exists some `c`") makes any
systematically wrong but point-independent term invisible. A renderer
that drops a whole prior factor whose value happens not to move with
the point, that double-counts a normalizer, or that scores a `Beta` as
a `Kumaraswamy` at coincidentally matched moments, all shift `c` and
leave the spread untouched. The suite would stay green while the
emitted program denoted a different measure. This module therefore
replaces the existential with a **named-constant criterion** (NCC):
for each `(backend, example)` cell the expected offset is derived in
closed form ahead of the measurement, pinned in
[`_EXPECTED_OFFSET`][tests.transpile.test_expected_offsets._EXPECTED_OFFSET],
and asserted as an equality rather than as a mere constancy.

Derivation
----------

Write `c(T, M) = mean_i (log p_QVR(z_i) - log p_T(z_i))` over the
gallery point set for target `T` and example `M`. A positive `c` means
the backend scores *lower* than the reference, so it dropped a term.
The question the registry answers is which terms each target is
entitled to drop.

**1. Normalizers of the target's own scoring API.** Every backend in
the Docker matrix is probed through an API that returns a fully
normalized joint. Stan is probed with
`cmdstanpy.CmdStanModel.log_prob(..., jacobian=False)`, so its value
is the constrained-space `target` accumulator with the
change-of-variables term removed, and the Stan renderer emits
`target += <family>_lpdf(<variate> | <args>);` increments rather than
`~` sampling statements, which is the form that retains every
normalizing constant Stan would otherwise be free to drop. NumPyro,
Pyro, PyMC, Edward2, Turing and Gen are probed through
`log_density` / `log_prob_sum` / `compile_logp` / `logjoint` /
`assess`, each documented to return normalized per-site densities.
JAGS and BUGS are scored through the JAGS graph, and WebPPL through
each distribution object's `score` method. Thus no target is entitled
to a constant on this account, and the API contributes zero.

**2. Truncation renormalizers of composed folded families.** This is
the one term that is genuinely dropped, and it is dropped by exactly
the targets that lack a native folded family. QVR's `HalfCauchy(gamma)`,
`HalfNormal(sigma)` and `HalfStudentT(df, scale)` are the folded
densities

    f_half(v) = 2 * f_base(v)    for v >= 0,

so `log f_half = log 2 + log f_base` at every point of the support.
[`FAMILY_META`][quivers.transpile.family_meta.FAMILY_META] records how
each target spells each family, and the renderer may rewrite that
spelling at the site; the two together give the effective spelling:

* `numpyro`, `pyro`, `pymc` name the native `HalfCauchy` /
  `HalfNormal` / `HalfStudentT` class, which carries the factor of two.
  `numpyro` and `pyro` ship no `HalfStudentT`, so both graft one, in
  each case a fold of the symmetric base that scores the `log 2`.
* `edward2` names the native `HalfCauchy` and `HalfNormal`, but TFP has
  no `HalfStudentT` and `renderers/edward2.py` rewrites that site to
  the bare `edward2.StudentT(df, 0, scale)`, dropping `log 2` per site
  while `FAMILY_META` still reads `edward2 -> "HalfStudentT"`.
* `turing` composes `truncated(Cauchy(0, gamma), 0, Inf)`, and
  Distributions.jl's `truncated` divides by `1 - F(0) = 1/2`, which
  restores the same `log 2`.
* `bugs` and `jags` emit the symmetric base (`dt(0, tau, 1)`,
  `dnorm(0, tau)`) with a one-sided truncation suffix, and JAGS
  renormalizes over the truncation interval.
* `stan` emits the **symmetric base density alone** for all three
  (`cauchy_lpdf`, `normal_lpdf`, `student_t_lpdf`), with the
  non-negativity carried by a `real<lower=0>` declaration rather than
  by a renormalization. Each such site scores `log 2` below the
  reference.
* `gen` and `webppl` do the same for `HalfCauchy` and `HalfNormal`
  (`Gen.cauchy`, `Cauchy({...})`), but resolve `HalfStudentT` to a
  grafted runtime helper (`half_student_t`, `HalfStudentT`) whose
  scorer adds `log 2` explicitly, so they keep the renormalizer for
  that family alone. `turing` grafts the same helper.

The drop is therefore a property of the pair `(target, family)`, not of
the target alone, which is what
[`_DROPS_HALF_NORMALIZER`][tests.transpile.test_expected_offsets._DROPS_HALF_NORMALIZER]
records.

`log 2` does not depend on the parameter point or on the data, so the
drop is legitimate under Theorem 4.1. It is also *countable*: the
number of scalar folded-density factors of a given family a program
contains is a syntactic property of its QVR source, namely the sum,
over every `sample` / `observe` step naming that family, of the product
of the cardinalities of the axes attached to that step, counting steps
nested in a `marginalize` scope as well. Hence

    c(T, M) = sum_f drops_half(T, f) * n_f(M) * log 2,

with `drops_half(T, f) = 1` when `T` spells `f` as its bare symmetric
base and `0` otherwise.

**3. The zeros-trick carrier constant on the BUGS / JAGS engines.**
Neither engine has a `target +=` statement, so a family whose density
they cannot name is added to the joint through the zeros trick: the
renderer writes the density out in closed form and scores a host-bound
`zeros[n] = 0` against a Poisson whose rate is that density negated.
Because `log P(X = 0; lambda) = -lambda`, the relation contributes
exactly the closed form back. A rate must be positive, though, and the
negated log-density is not, so the idiom conventionally lifts the rate
by a constant `C` chosen to dominate the density over the whole
support, which subtracts `C` from the joint at every row it scores:

    zeros[n] ~ dpois(C - log f(y_n))   contributes   log f(y_n) - C.

`C` is a fixed literal of the renderer rather than a function of the
point, so the drop is legitimate under Theorem 4.1 and countable the
same way the folded-family factors are, over the `observe` steps
naming a family the target lowers this way. The three zeros-trick
families are not treated alike:
[`renderers/jags.py`][quivers.transpile.renderers.jags] lifts the rate
by `1e6` for `MixtureNormal` and `Kumaraswamy`, whose closed forms are
densities and so exceed one where the density does, and emits the bare
`-(<term>)` for `BetaBinomial`, whose closed form is negative over the
fixtures' support and so needs no lift.
[`_ZEROS_TRICK_OFFSET_FAMILIES`][tests.transpile.test_expected_offsets._ZEROS_TRICK_OFFSET_FAMILIES]
records which pairs carry the constant, and
`test_zeros_trick_table_agrees_with_the_emit` reads both the
membership and the value of `C` back off the emitted program rather
than taking either on trust.

**4. Everything else is zero.** Argument aliasing (`loc -> mu`,
`concentration -> a`) and parameterization substitution (BUGS and JAGS
precision `tau = 1/sigma^2`) are algebraic identities on the density,
not on a normalizer, so they contribute nothing. Plate expansion,
`filldist` / `arraydist`, `sample_shape`, and per-index `for` loops
all denote the same product measure. Change-of-variables terms are
either absent (identity `Psi` on every non-Stan target) or removed by
the probe (`jacobian=False`).

Validation legs
---------------

The pinned numbers rest on two independent legs, neither of which is
the other's restatement.

1. `test_registry_offset_matches_the_closed_form_derivation` recomputes
   `sum_f drops_half(T, f) * n_f(M) * log 2 + sum_f lifts(T, f) *
   m_f(M) * C` from the example's `.qvr`
   source, in process and without Docker, and requires the registry to
   equal it exactly. A registry entry cannot be quietly retuned to
   whatever a container returned; it has to agree with a count taken
   off the program text.
2. `test_backend_offset_matches_registry` measures the offset in the
   pinned runtime and requires it to match the registry within the
   suite's equivalence tolerance. The tolerance floor is `5e-4`,
   roughly 1400 times smaller than a single dropped `log 2`, so one
   unaccounted truncation renormalizer, one missing prior factor, or
   any other point-independent term above a milli-nat fails the cell.

Unexplained offsets are never absorbed. An entry may be registered as
[`Unexplained`][tests.transpile.test_expected_offsets.Unexplained] to
record a measurement the derivation does not account for, and
`test_no_unexplained_offsets_are_registered` then fails until the cell
appears in
[`_ACKNOWLEDGED_UNEXPLAINED`][tests.transpile.test_expected_offsets._ACKNOWLEDGED_UNEXPLAINED],
whose sole purpose is to make such an admission loud.

`HalfCauchy.target_names` maps `stan -> "cauchy"`, `gen -> "cauchy"`,
`webppl -> "Cauchy"`, all symmetric bases emitted without a truncation
wrapper, against `numpyro / pyro / pymc / edward2 -> "HalfCauchy"`
(native folded class), `turing -> "truncated"` (Distributions.jl
renormalizes) and `bugs / jags -> "dt"` carrying a one-sided truncation
suffix that JAGS renormalizes over.

`HalfStudentT` splits differently. `stan -> "student_t"` is a bare
base, and so is `edward2`: TFP ships no `HalfStudentT` class, so
`renderers/edward2.py` rewrites the site to the location-scale
`edward2.StudentT(df, 0, scale)` and leans on the fold being an
additive-constant shift, which is exactly a dropped `log 2` per site.
`gen -> "half_student_t"`, `turing -> "HalfStudentT"` and
`webppl -> "HalfStudentT"` all resolve to a grafted runtime helper
whose scorer adds `log 2` explicitly, so those three targets keep the
renormalizer for this family while dropping it for the other two. A
single per-target flag cannot express that, hence the keying by family.

`bugs` and `jags` keep a zero here for `HalfStudentT` for the same
reason they do for the other two folded families: the renderer writes
`sigma ~ dt(0,1/(scale*scale),df) T (0 ,)`, the symmetric base under a
one-sided truncation suffix, and JAGS renormalizes over the truncation
interval. The suffix is the whole of the entitlement question on these
two targets, and it is what
`test_drop_table_agrees_with_the_family_registry` cannot read off the
name table: `dt` and `dnorm` are symmetric spellings whether or not a
`T ( , )` follows, so the assertion below keeps them out of
`bare_base` on the strength of the suffix rather than of the name.

# entry in `_DROPS_HALF_NORMALIZER`.
#
# Population workflow for a newly-live cell: derive `half_sites` from
# the example's `.qvr` (every `sample` / `observe` step naming a folded
# family contributes the product of the cardinalities of the axes
# attached to it, nested `marginalize` scopes included), restrict to the
# families whose drop set contains the target to get `dropped_sites`,
# add the entry, and confirm the measured offset agrees. Never read the
# measurement first and write it down: the derivation is the authority
# and the measurement is its test.
