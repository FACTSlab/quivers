"""Negative controls for the transpile equivalence check.

The gallery equivalence tier
([`test_gallery_numeric_equivalence`][tests.transpile.test_gallery_numeric_equivalence])
asserts that a transpiled program's log-density differs from the QVR
reference by a point-independent constant, per Theorem 4.1 of
[docs/semantics/transpile-correctness.md](../../docs/semantics/transpile-correctness.md).
A green run of that tier is evidence of nothing on its own. The check
has twice decayed into a tautology while staying green: first when it
scored a single point, where the spread of one difference is
identically zero; then when one example's point set carried
byte-identical observed data, which restores the same vacuity for any
backend that drops a data-dependent term. Both times the tier passed
and proved nothing.

This module supplies the missing half of the argument. For an
explicitly enumerated grid of `(example, backend)` cells the gallery
tier currently passes, it takes the **emitted backend program**,
rewrites it into a program denoting a different measure, and asserts
the equivalence check **fails** on the mutant. The catalogue of
rewrites lives in
[`tests.transpile._mutations`][tests.transpile._mutations] and is
grounded in defects this codebase shipped: a family's arguments
transposed, a sampling operator dropping data-only summands, a
marginalize block lowered to a live draw, a continuous value
truncated to an integer, a gather reading one index off.

Three test families run here:

1. **Rejection.** Every catalogue mutant must produce a spread above
   the equivalence tolerance, and above a pinned per-mutation floor.
   The floor is what makes this a decay alarm rather than a one-off
   demonstration: a mutant whose spread collapses toward the
   tolerance because the point set stopped moving still clears
   `spread > atol` for a while, and the floor trips first.
2. **Acceptance.** A rewrite that shifts the log-density by a
   constant must pass. Without it, every rejection above would be
   satisfied by a check that fails on everything.
3. **Blind spots.** Rewrites the check provably does *not* reject,
   pinned as measured facts. Each is a defect the constant-spread
   contract cannot see: a support constraint erased, a truncation
   dropped, an exported value negated. Asserting they stay invisible
   keeps the registry honest, and each entry states what a check able
   to catch it would have to look at instead.

Runtime: each mutant costs one container invocation, so the grid is a
deterministic, hand-picked subset rather than the full cross-product
of catalogue and backends. Every backend that ships a probe image
carries at least four mutations, and every defect class is exercised
on at least four backends. Nothing here is sampled; a randomised
subset would make the suite's measured sensitivity a different number
on every run, and a mutation that stopped being rejected could hide
behind a run that never selected it.
