"""Semantic mutation catalogue for the equivalence sensitivity suite.

A transpile correctness check is only as good as the set of wrong
programs it rejects. This module holds that set: for a small,
explicitly enumerated grid of `(example, backend)` cells that the
gallery equivalence tier currently passes, it records precise
rewrites of the *emitted backend source* that turn the correct
program into one denoting a different measure.

Every rewrite is a literal-text substitution with a pinned
occurrence count. Two properties follow, and both matter:

1. The mutant is a **valid program in the target language**, so the
   backend's own probe evaluates it and the harness compares two
   real log-density vectors rather than an exception.
2. The mutation is **anchored to text the renderer actually emits**,
   so a renderer change that moves the anchor fails loudly with a
   maintenance message rather than silently mutating nothing and
   reporting a mutant the check "rejected".

The defect classes are drawn from failures this codebase actually
shipped (a family's shape and scale arguments transposed; a sampling
statement dropping the data-only summands of a log-density; a
marginalize block lowered to a live draw; a continuous leaf cast
through an integer dtype; a gather reading one index off) plus the
standard perturbations of a probabilistic program: a prior term
removed, a parameter-dependent normalizer removed, a parameter
scaled, a nearby family substituted.

Each [`Mutation`][tests.transpile._mutations.Mutation] also pins a
`min_spread` floor measured on the current point set. The floor is
what turns the catalogue into a decay alarm: a mutant whose spread
merely exceeds the equivalence tolerance still passes the reject
test while the point set quietly loses its variation, so the floor
asserts the mutant stays as loud as it was when the catalogue was
built.

sampled discrete latent, so their probes score a conditional joint
rather than the marginal and there is no correct baseline to mutate
away from. BUGS raises `UnsupportedConstruct` on the fixture's

runtime rejects the fixture's Dirichlet concentration before any
