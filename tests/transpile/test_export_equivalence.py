"""Tier-4 export equivalence on the documentation gallery.

A QVR program declared `prog : A -> B` denotes a Markov kernel from
`A` to `B`. Its meaning is a measure on the object it **returns**, not
merely a joint density over `(latents, observations)`. The two are
independent pieces of information: two programs can carry the
identical joint and push forward differently, so a renderer that
computes the right density and returns the wrong thing denotes the
wrong kernel while every log-density check passes.

[`test_gallery_numeric_equivalence`][tests.transpile.test_gallery_numeric_equivalence]
validates the joint alone, and its blindness to the return clause is
not a conjecture: `tests/transpile/_mutations.py` pins
`exported_value_negated` as a measured
[`BlindSpot`][tests.transpile._mutations.BlindSpot] on both Stan and
NumPyro, where negating the exported value moves the constant-spread
statistic by 2.6e-05 and 2.3e-05 against a harness noise floor of the
same order. Every backend shares that blind spot, because the joint
is what the tier reads and the export never enters it.

This module closes the gap. For every `(backend, example)` cell the
gallery tier scores numerically, it compares the backend's exported
value against the QVR reference's, elementwise, at **every** point of
the multi-point set.

Why the comparison is well-posed, and where it would not be. At a
clamped point every latent is pinned to its ground truth, so a
deterministic export is a function of the point and nothing else, and
the two sides can be compared exactly up to float round-off. An
export that was itself an unclamped random site would be two
independent draws on the two sides, and comparing those would pass or
fail by chance; that case is excluded by construction rather than
tolerated.
[`test_export_reference_is_deterministic`][tests.transpile.test_export_equivalence.test_export_reference_is_deterministic]
asserts the exclusion for every example, by re-tracing the reference
under two distinct global RNG seeds and requiring the exported value
to agree **bit for bit**, and the in-container probes each refuse to
report an export the point did not pin.

Why the comparison is not vacuous. Elementwise equality of two
concrete vectors cannot be satisfied by an evaluator that computes
nothing, but it *could* be satisfied by a backend returning a frozen
constant if the reference itself never moved.
[`test_export_reference_varies_across_points`][tests.transpile.test_export_equivalence.test_export_reference_varies_across_points]
removes that: the reference export must take at least two distinct
values across the point set.

What the check rejects, measured rather than claimed. The mutation
tier at the bottom of this module negates an export, returns a
different site, drops the export entirely, and permutes a vector
export, on the emitted source of every target that has an export
surface, and requires each mutant to be rejected with a pinned margin
over the tolerance. Each rewrite is anchored to text the renderer
actually emits and its occurrence count is pinned, so a renderer
change that moves the anchor fails loudly instead of silently
mutating nothing.

Per-target export surfaces, all ten of them, each read through the
target's own construct rather than by looking the name up in a trace:

| target | surface |
| --- | --- |
| numpyro, pyro, edward2 | the model function's `return` |
| turing | the `@model` return, under `condition` |
| gen | the second element of `Gen.assess` |
| webppl | the `model` function's `return` |
| stan | a `generated quantities` alias `<name>_value` |
| pymc | `pymc.Deterministic("<name>_value", ...)` |
| jags, bugs | a deterministic relation `<name>_value <- <name>` |

The last three targets have no program-level return: Stan, PyMC, and
the BUGS family each expose a quantity by naming it, so the renderer
emits the alias and the probe reads that alias. Dropping it is a
detected defect on those targets exactly as dropping a `return` is on
the other seven.

"""Round-off budget for
[`export_atol`][tests.transpile.test_export_equivalence.export_atol],
in units of the float32 grid spacing at the compared magnitude.

The reference export is a `torch` tensor under the default float32
dtype, and every backend recomputes the same function from the same
clamped inputs in its own arithmetic (float64 for Stan, JAX, torch,
Julia, WebPPL and JAGS; float32 for TensorFlow). Two evaluations of
the same deterministic function therefore differ only by the float32
representation of the reference's intermediates, which is a relative
error at the float32 grid.

The budget is calibrated against a direct measurement rather than a
guess: across every live `(backend, example)` cell, every point of
the six-point set, and every element of every exported vector, the
largest disagreement is
`_MEASURED_WORST_ULP_RATIO` float32 ULPs. Eight ULPs leaves three
bits of headroom over that worst case, and
[`test_export_tolerance_is_tight`][tests.transpile.test_export_equivalence.test_export_tolerance_is_tight]
pins both numbers so the headroom cannot quietly grow.

This is a headroom figure, not a necessity. Widening it is never the
fix for a failure: a real export defect moves the value by a
multiple of its own magnitude, not by bits."""
