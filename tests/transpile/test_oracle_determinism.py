"""Tests for deterministic QVR reference log densities.

The numeric-equivalence tests assume that each QVR reference value is
reproducible, not a draw from an estimator. The structural
[`assert_all_latents_clamped`][tests.transpile.probes.qvr.assert_all_latents_clamped]
check can name unclamped recorded sites, but it cannot see latents
inside a `SampledComposition`. This module tests determinism directly
by tracing each program under several fixed RNG seeds and comparing the
joint and every recorded log-density summand bit for bit.

The gallery tests run this comparison at every evaluation point,
including programs whose compositions contain unrecorded intermediate
latents. A constructed program supplies the positive control: its
recorded sites are clamped, but an internal latent is sampled during
`log_prob`, so the structural check accepts it and the behavioral check
rejects it. Additional cases cover a one-ULP difference, cancellation
between moving summands, seed-dependent site presence, identical NaN
payloads, degenerate seed sets, and restoration of the caller RNG state.
