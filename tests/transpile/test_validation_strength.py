"""Pin the strength of the transpile equivalence check itself.

Theorem 4.1 of
[docs/semantics/transpile-correctness.md](../../docs/semantics/transpile-correctness.md)
says a transpiled program is correct when its log-density agrees with
the QVR reference measure at **every** point of the model's support,
up to an additive constant that does not depend on the point. The
gallery suite turns that into an operational check: evaluate both
sides on a point set, subtract the mean difference, and require the
residual spread to sit under a tight tolerance.

That operationalisation has four independent failure surfaces, and
the first two have already fired in this repository:

1. **The tolerance can drift.** Widening the atol until a failing
   fixture goes green converts a detected measure-inequivalence back
   into a pass.
2. **The point set can collapse.** The spread of a difference
   sequence is a statement about *variation*. A one-point set has
   spread identically zero whatever the two evaluators computed, and
   a set whose data section is byte-identical throughout is the same
   vacuity restricted to the data coordinates: a backend that drops a
   data-dependent summand holds a perfectly constant offset as the
   latents move and passes.
3. **The point set can be lucky.** Six points drawn at one seed are
   one finite sample of an infinite support, so a claim proved on
   them is a claim about that draw. A coordinate the draw happened to
   move a long way looks well covered; the same coordinate at another
   seed may move by a hair, and nothing in the aggregate statistics of
   the first draw says which of the two the perturber generally does.
   This is the **seed-locality gap**: sensitivity established at one
   seed is not sensitivity of the design.
4. **The excursion can be too short.** Every displacement is
   proportional to the perturbation scale, so a defect whose per-point
   discrepancy is *nonlinear* in the point contributes a spread that
   grows superlinearly in that scale. A discrepancy quadratic in the
   displacement is roughly nine times louder at three times the scale,
   which means a real defect can sit under tolerance at one excursion
   and be rejected outright at a wider one. This is the
   **excursion-magnitude gap**, and unlike the first three it is not
   closed by adding points at the same scale.

Each of the first two decays left a green test that proved nothing.
The principle this module enforces is that a check is not validated
until what it rejects has been demonstrated, that the demonstration is
made by the suite on every run rather than by hand once, and that it
is made across independent draws rather than at one. The tests below
therefore assert the *properties that give the equivalence assertion
its teeth*, not the equivalence itself:

1. `test_tolerance_constants_are_pinned` and
   `test_adaptive_atol_stays_under_ceiling` pin the tolerance model.
2. `test_gallery_point_set_size_is_pinned`,
   `test_single_point_comparison_is_vacuous`,
   `test_min_points_rejects_a_collapsed_point_set`, and
   `test_point_set_defaults_are_pinned` pin the point count and the
   draw the gallery takes by default.
3. `test_seed_sweep_draws_independent_point_sets`,
   `test_seed_sweep_is_independent_for_every_cell`,
   `test_no_point_collapses_onto_the_ground_truth`, and
   `test_every_quantified_coordinate_varies` pin per-coordinate
   coverage of the dimensions Theorem 4.1 quantifies over, and pin
   that the sweep's draws are distinct and its points do not collapse,
   at every swept seed. The first fixes that the builder answers to
   its seed at all; the second fixes that it answers on every cell,
   which is what keeps a claim proved once from being reported as
   proved four times.
4. `test_reference_joint_is_in_support_and_varies` pins that every
   point is in the support and that the reference measure genuinely
   moves, at every swept seed.
5. `test_point_set_exposes_a_planted_coordinate_defect` pins that a
   defect confined to any single coordinate is rejected, at every
   swept seed, which is the claim the seed-locality gap otherwise
   leaves as a statement about seed 0.
6. `test_wider_excursion_detects_a_nonlinear_defect` and
   `test_wide_excursion_gain_covers_the_corpus` measure the
   excursion-magnitude gap: they exhibit, per cell, a defect quadratic
   in the displacement that the default excursion provably cannot
   detect and the wider one provably does, they check that the wider
   set gains strictly more against that nonlinear shape than against a
   linear control, and they keep the conditional those claims are made
   under from decaying into a vacuous one.
7. The `test_spread_*` family pins the behaviour of the spread
   statistic on synthetic difference sequences of known magnitude,
   which is the direct measurement of what the assertion rejects.

quadratic defect at least 2.4x smaller, while cells gated in at 1.05x

    That is the right scope for the mechanism and the wrong scope for
    the claim. Independence is a property of how each *coordinate kind*
    consumes randomness, and the corpus spans several: a real coordinate
    moves by a Gaussian step and is essentially certain to differ
    between draws, whereas an integer coordinate rounds its step and
    then clamps it into an attested window, so a count with a narrow
    window has only a handful of admissible values and two seeds landing
    on the same one is an ordinary event rather than a coincidence. A
    cell built entirely from such coordinates could return the same
    point set at every seed while the one example the mechanism test
    watches goes on differing.

    What that would cost is the sweep's whole premise. Every per-cell
    claim in this module is proved once per seed, so a cell whose four
    draws coincide is a cell whose claims were proved once and reported
    four times, and the seed-locality gap those claims exist to close
    would be closed only on paper. Nothing in the aggregate output says
    so: four identical draws pass every assertion four times over.

    The schedule promises six points covering the latents-only,

    that comes back byte-identical to the ground truth quietly breaks
    that promise: the set is a five-point set, the mode it belonged to
    is covered once rather than twice, and nothing in the aggregate
    statistics says so. The per-coordinate coverage check does not
    catch it either, because the coordinate still moves at the *other*
    point of the same mode.

    The failure is real and seed-dependent. An integer perturbation
    rounds a real step to a whole count and then clamps it into the
    value's window, and on a sparse vector of small counts both stages
    can annihilate every entry of the draw at once: entries at the
    bottom of the window only move upward, entries at the top only
    downward, and a step comparable to one count rounds to zero about a
    third of the time. Nothing about the default seed makes that
    impossible; it simply does not happen there, which is precisely why
    the claim has to be made across seeds.

    One duplicate is admissible, and the exemption is derived rather
    than registered: a latents-only point of a program that declares no
    latent sample site has an empty section to perturb, so it *is* the
    ground truth and no perturber could make it otherwise. Such a

    """Every coordinate Theorem 4.1 quantifies over actually moves
    across the point set, at every swept seed.

    The theorem quantifies over the whole support, so the operational
    check inherits a coverage obligation the aggregate statistics hide:
    a point set that never moves a given coordinate proves nothing
    about that coordinate. The joint can move a great deal while one
    observation array stays byte-identical throughout, and against
    such a set any backend error that is a function of that array
    alone is absorbed into the constant `c`. That is not a
    hypothetical: a data section frozen at ground truth is precisely
    what makes a dropped data-dependent summand invisible.

    Two families of coordinate are checked, and each must take at
    least two distinct values across the set:

    1. Every latent sample site of the compiled program. A site the
       point set never pins is worse than one it never moves, so a
       missing site fails here too.
    2. Every observed data array the point carries.

    A coordinate that is genuinely outside the quantified space, a
    plate subscript fixed by the experimental design, needs an entry
    in `_UNPERTURBABLE_COORDINATES` stating the argument. The registry
    is checked in three directions: an unexplained frozen coordinate
    fails, a registered coordinate that has started moving fails as a
    stale claim, and an entry whose `kind` the point builder's own
    classifier does not confirm fails as a misfiled one. None of the
    three may be settled by editing the assertion.

    The seed sweep is what makes "moves" a property of the perturber
    rather than of one draw. A coordinate whose step can round to zero,
    an integer count near the edge of its attested window most of all,
    may move at the default seed and freeze at another, and a
    single-seed check would call that covered. The registry is
    correspondingly a claim at *every* seed: a coordinate exempted as
    structural must be frozen in all of them, since a subscript that
    starts moving at one seed is a subscript the perturber is now
    stepping.

    Counting distinct values shows a coordinate *moved*; this test

    that fires exactly on the points where that coordinate left its

    standing in for a Jacobian or normaliser difference. A dropped
    data-dependent summand has precisely this shape, constant wherever
    the perturbation did not reach it.

    Squared distance is the leading term of any discrepancy that

    """A wider excursion changes *what the check can detect*, not
    merely how loudly it detects it.

    The six points the gallery evaluates move each coordinate a fixed
    fraction of its own scale. That is enough for a defect whose
    per-point discrepancy is constant on a region, which is the shape
    every historical bug in this repository had. It is not enough for a
    defect that vanishes at the ground truth and grows with distance
    from it, because such a defect contributes a spread proportional to
    the *square* of the excursion: shrink the excursion and it goes
    quiet quadratically.

    This test exhibits one. It plants
    [`_quadratic_defect`][tests.transpile.test_validation_strength._quadratic_defect]
    on the default point set, scaled so its spread is
    `_NONLINEAR_DEFECT_HEADROOM` of the tolerance, and asserts two
    things about the same defect:

    1. The default point set **accepts** it. This is the gap, stated
       as a measurement rather than as a worry: a real defect of this
       shape and this magnitude passes the gallery equivalence cell
       today.
    2. The wide point set **rejects** it, with the constant-only
       sequence still accepted so the rejection is attributable to the
       planted term.

    The second claim is conditional on the wide set having actually
    travelled `_WIDE_EXCURSION_GAIN` further, and the condition is
    measured from the realised points rather than assumed from the
    scale argument. A cell whose coordinates are integer steps clamped
    to their attested range does not travel further at a wider scale,
    however large the scale is, so for such a cell the excursion is not
    the lever and the claim is not made. That is not an exemption to be
    granted by hand: the ratio is recomputed every run, and
    `test_wide_excursion_gain_covers_the_corpus` fails if the
    conditional ever stops firing across the corpus.

    the corpus, and the wider scale never yields a narrower set.

    `test_wider_excursion_detects_a_nonlinear_defect` is a conditional,
    and a conditional is the quietest way for a measurement to stop
    measuring: if the antecedent ever held nowhere, every one of its
    parametrisations would still pass while demonstrating nothing.
    This test is the guard, and it makes two claims.

    First, monotonicity. A larger requested scale must never produce a
    point set that travels less than the smaller one does. The redraw
    ladder is the mechanism that could break this: a wide draw that
    leaves the support is halved, and halved again, so a scale asked to
    reach further can come back having reached less. That would make
    the wide set strictly worse than the default one, and the gallery's
    own excursion would be sitting at the edge of the support rather
    than inside it.

    Second, coverage. At least `_MIN_WIDE_GAIN_FRACTION` of the swept
    (example, seed) pairs must clear `_WIDE_EXCURSION_GAIN`, so the
    conditional demonstrably fires. The pairs that do not clear it are
    the ones whose excursion is dominated by integer coordinates
    stepping inside an attested range, where a wider scale reshuffles
    which admissible integer each draw lands on rather than reaching
    further; those cells are covered by the constant-magnitude planted
    defect instead, which is the shape their discrete coordinates
    admit.
