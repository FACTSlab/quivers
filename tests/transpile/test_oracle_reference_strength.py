"""Independent verification of the QVR reference oracle itself.

Every numeric claim the transpile tier makes is a claim *relative to
the QVR oracle*. Theorem 4.1 of
[docs/semantics/transpile-correctness.md](../../docs/semantics/transpile-correctness.md)
asks only that `log p_QVR - log p_backend` be the same constant at
every point, so the backend comparison is invariant to adding a
constant to the oracle and, at a point set where the oracle and the
backend read the *same* wrong value, invariant to far more than that.
The oracle therefore cannot be validated by the thing it validates.

Two independent witnesses cover the pinned registry, and
[`test_every_pinned_example_has_an_independent_witness`][tests.transpile.test_oracle_reference_strength.test_every_pinned_example_has_an_independent_witness]
asserts the cover is total:

1. **Container witness.** An example with at least one live
   `(backend, example)` cell in
   [`test_gallery_numeric_equivalence`][tests.transpile.test_gallery_numeric_equivalence]
   has its oracle re-derived by a foreign runtime (Stan's own
   `log_prob`, NumPyro's `log_joint`, JAGS's node scores) at every
   point of the set.
2. **Raw-torch witness, this module.** Eight examples have *no* live
   cell at all: `bnn`, `continuous_hmm`, `linear_gaussian_ssm`,
   `mixture_model`, `parametric_pooling`, `pmf`,
   `tensor_contraction`, `tree_categorical`. Every backend either
   raises a pinned `UnsupportedConstruct` or sits in
   `_SKIP_PROBE_INCOMPATIBLE`. Nothing outside this module ever
   compares their oracle against an independent computation, so this
   module rebuilds each joint from the `.qvr` source and the `.md`
   synthetic-data snippet in raw `torch.distributions` and asserts
   the match **per site** and **per point**.

Per site rather than per joint on purpose. Matching only the total
lets two errors cancel: a prior term inflated by the same amount a
likelihood term is deflated reproduces the joint exactly. The trace
exposes `Trace.sites[name].log_prob`, so the reconstruction is
compared summand by summand, and a site the reconstruction does not
model must score exactly zero in the trace (the deterministic `let`
bindings, whose value is a function of already-scored sites).

Conventions the reconstruction follows, matching the oracle's:

- **Constrained space, no unconstraining Jacobian.** A positive scale
  is scored by its own density at its own value; no `log |dtheta/dz|`
  term is added.
- **Sum, never mean, over a plate.** The joint is a product over the
  plate index, so its log is a sum.
- **Discrete-marginalized latents integrated by `logsumexp`.**
  `mixture_model`'s per-row component assignment is integrated in
  closed form, not sampled.

What the reconstruction *rejects* is measured, not asserted.
[`test_reconstruction_rejects_mutant`][tests.transpile.test_oracle_reference_strength.test_reconstruction_rejects_mutant]
runs a catalogue of named statistical defects through the same code
path (a plate averaged instead of summed, a mixture collapsed to one
component, a location and a log-scale head transposed, a Jacobian
added, a wiring that conditions the emission on the previous state,
a soft sum-to-zero factor dropped) and requires each to move the
joint past a pinned floor. A defect that stops being rejected trips
the floor before it trips the tolerance.

Eight gallery examples ship synthetic data and carry no pin at all,
and this module holds their exemptions to the same standard rather
than to their own prose. All eight are sequence models binding a
latent to a `SampledComposition`, and each must be shown to report a
joint that no pin could hold: either the value moves when the
composition's quadrature node count changes, so what the oracle
returns is the rule's approximation rather than the model's density,
or the composite site scores exactly zero at every value it is given,
so the joint is missing the prior on the only latent the program
declares. Which of the two holds is declared per example and
re-measured on every run. An example that stops exhibiting either has
a density worth pinning and loses its exemption instead of keeping an
unpinned joint forever.

The second exemption ground, a `.qvr` that declares no probabilistic
program at all, is currently claimed by nobody. An empty category is
a claim in its own right rather than an absence of work, so it is
declared empty in
[`_DECLARED_STRUCTURAL_EXEMPT`][tests.transpile.test_oracle_reference_strength._DECLARED_STRUCTURAL_EXEMPT]
and checked over the examples that *could* claim it: the four whose
source parses to no `ProgramDecl`. Each is required to land on one
side of the line for a stated reason. `pmf` and `tensor_contraction`
score a joint regardless, since their `.md` snippet wraps the
compiled composition in a `MonadicProgram`, so both carry a pin and a
reconstruction here; `schema_chart_parser` and `term_autoencoder`
leave `load_gallery_data` with nothing to build, so the numeric tier
never reaches them and neither registry may name them. A check
parametrized over the exempt set alone would have gone quiet the
moment that set emptied, which is exactly when it has the most to
say.

    so both are scored along the canonical path: the first factor's
    intermediate is bound to the image of the base measure's origin,
    which for a Normal factor is its own location, and the site's
    value enters through the second.

    `object Driver : Real 4`, `object State : Real 8`,
    `object Hidden : Real 32`, `object Obs : Real 4`, so the
    transition reads a 12-column `(driver, state)` row and both
    inner factors emit a 64-column `(loc, log_scale)` pair over
    `Hidden`. The eight MLPs' weights are compile-time draws with no
    spelling in the source and are taken as given; the layer order,
    the head splits, the four densities and the sum over the 32-row

    Only the two mutants that drop a whole term are catalogued, and
    that is a measurement rather than an oversight. A prefix factor is
    scored at its own location, so it contributes its normalizer and
    nothing else, and defects in the *shape* of the map reach the
    joint only through that normalizer: dropping every `tanh` in the
    transition moves it by 0.086 nats, reading a zero state into the
    emission by 0.85, and ignoring the observation head's log-scale
    columns by 3.5. Each is above the pin tolerance and far below the
    4000-tolerance grip the mutant catalogue declares, so cataloguing
    them would lower that floor while claiming to raise coverage.
    What the numbers say is that the path density is much less
    sensitive to a chain's nonlinear structure than the marginal it
    stands in for would be, which bears on what a pin over it can be

source is not the only place a program can come from, and both
algebra-level examples take the other route. `pmf` and
`tensor_contraction` each carry a `.md` snippet that wraps the

`ProgramDecl` and build no dataset either, so the numeric tier never
reaches them and they need no exemption.

# do so are the two ways an oracle joint can fail to be a value worth
# pinning:
#
# 1. A **rule-dependent** joint. Where the intermediate is stochastic
#    and reparameterised, the integral is a deterministic quadrature
#    over a finite node set, so its value is an approximation whose
#    error is a property of the rule. Pinning it would enshrine that
#    error as the reference, which is the one thing a reference pin
#    exists to catch, since Theorem 4.1's quotient cannot see a
#    point-independent oracle error.
# 2. A **flat** latent. Where the chain returns no density at all, the
#    site scores exactly zero whatever its value, so the joint is
#    missing the prior on the only latent the program declares. There
#    is nothing to pin because there is no density.
#
# Which of the two holds for which example is measured below, per
# point, and declared here rather than inferred, so an example that
# changes ground fails instead of sliding quietly from one to the

    the same number and a rule-level artefact does not.

    The shift is required to exceed
    [`reference_pin_atol`][tests.transpile.test_gallery_numeric_equivalence.reference_pin_atol]
    at the moving point, which is precisely the threshold that makes
    the exemption necessary rather than merely defensible: a
    quadrature converged to within the pin tolerance would be pinnable,
    and the pin would then be holding the model rather than the rule.

    At *some* point rather than at every point, for the same reason
    the mutant catalogue asks for that: a quadrature error can vanish
    at one configuration of the latents and reappear at the next, and
    demanding visibility everywhere would force out the examples where
    it is real but intermittent.
