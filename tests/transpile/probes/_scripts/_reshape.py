"""Shared in-container reshape helper for probe scripts.

The host harness sends each (param, data) value as a flat
row-major Python list under `points.json`. The model the probe
loads, however, typically declares the same name with a multi-
dimensional declared shape (e.g. Stan `array[16] int obs` or PyMC
`obs.shape == (16, 4)`). Each probe script imports
:func:`reshape_point` and rebuilds the multi-dimensional native
container the underlying runtime expects.

The reshape table arrives in `/io/shapes.json`:

    {"obs": [16], "rule_weights": [16], "logits": [3, 4]}

The dtype table (optional) arrives in `/io/dtypes.json`:

    {"obs": "int", "logits": "float"}

A name absent from either table falls through to its raw
list value. The float / int cast applies even for scalars so
backends that distinguish `int` and `real` (Stan, JAGS) get the
right type.

The export channel rides alongside. `/io/export_names.json` holds
the QVR program's return-variable names, in declaration order:

    ["phi"]

A probe that finds the file must read the exported value out of the
emitted program's own return surface (the model function's `return`,
a Stan generated quantity, a Gen `assess` return value) and report
one entry per name per point under the result's `exports` key. The
file's absence means the caller did not ask for the export channel,
and the probe reports only log-densities.
