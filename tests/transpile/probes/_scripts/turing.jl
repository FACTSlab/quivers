# In-container Turing.jl probe.
#
# Reads /io/source.jl + /io/points.json; evals the @model source
# and writes /io/result.json with `Turing.logjoint(model, theta)`
# at each point.
#
# When /io/export_names.json is present the probe also reports the
# program's exported value at each point. Turing's export surface is
# the `@model` function's own `return`, which DynamicPPL hands back
# when the model instance is called; conditioning on the point's
# latents first makes that value a deterministic function of the
# point rather than of the sampler's generator.
#
# A simplex-valued latent needs one marshalling step beyond the
# reshape, which `_reshape.jl` supplies: every name the emitted model
# draws from a `Dirichlet` is rescaled by its own row sum on the way
# in, and a row too far from one to be float32 rounding raises. All
# this probe adds is the Turing-specific reading of which sites those
# are.
#
# Julia world-age note: `Base.eval` introduces a new method (the
# `@model`-expanded `model` factory) at a world age newer than the
# enclosing `main`'s. Calling `model_factory(args...)` directly from
# `main` would dispatch in `main`'s captured world, where the new
# method is not visible ("method too new to be called from this
# world context"). `Base.invokelatest` re-resolves dispatch in the
# latest world so the freshly-eval'd model is callable; we apply it
# to every cross-eval boundary call (factory construction, JSON
# coercions on params/data, `Turing.logjoint`).
