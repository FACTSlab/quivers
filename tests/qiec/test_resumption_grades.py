"""Holding a handler clause to the resumption grade it declares.

A grade is a promise other code relies on. A handler declared `0` may be
compiled without keeping the continuation alive at all, so a clause that
resumes anyway is not a stylistic lapse but a miscompilation waiting to
happen. Equally a `1` promises the continuation always runs, which a
caller may depend on for an effect to be observed.

The analysis counts invocations along the paths through a body, as an
interval: the fewest any path performs and the most any path performs. A
`case` is where the two diverge, and that is the case worth testing
hardest, because a single-path body cannot tell an interval apart from a
count.
