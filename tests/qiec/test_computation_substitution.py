"""Static substitution through computation terms, and what it must not touch.

Instantiating a callee's telescope at a call site means substituting into
its result type, its effect row, and eventually its body. The property
that makes this sound is that substitution is blind to rigid variables: a
declaration binder carries no identity and is matched by name, while a
case branch's skolem carries a derived identity and is left alone.

Every test here is paired. One half shows the substitution reaches a
position, and the other shows it stops at a binder that shadows the same
name, since a rewrite that reached too far would capture.
