"""Stable diagnostic codes for the conditions a tool dispatches on.

A code is what an editor, a CI gate, or a migration script keys off, so
it has to name the condition rather than the pass that happened to catch
it. Codes are attached where a rejection is raised, because only that
site knows which condition fired, and the lowerer preserves them rather
than overwriting with its own.

Every case here is a source module that must be rejected, paired with
the code the rejection must carry. A test that only checked rejection
would pass even if every condition collapsed to one code.
